# R Server 9.1 Installation for Linux Systems

**Looking for the latest release? See [Machine Learning Server for Linux installation](machine-learning-server-linux-install.md)**

Microsoft R Server is an enterprise class server for hosting and managing parallel and distributed workloads of R processes on servers and clusters. The server runs on a wide range of computing platforms, including Linux. 

This article explains how to install Microsoft R Server 9.1.0 on a standalone Linux server that has an internet connection. If your server has restrictions on internet access, see the instructions for an [offline installation](r-server-install-linux-offline.md).

If you previously installed version 9.0.1, it will be replaced with the 9.1.0 version. An 8.x version can run side-by-side 9.x, unaffected by the new installation.

## System requirements

+ Operating system must be a [supported version of Linux](r-server-install-supported-platforms.md) on a 64-bit with x86-compatible architecture (variously known as AMD64, Intel64, x86-64, IA-32e, EM64T, or x64 chips). Itanium chips (also known as IA-64) are not supported. Multiple-core chips are recommended.

+ Memory must be a minimum of 2 GB of RAM is required; 8 GB or more are recommended.

+ Disk space must be a minimum of 500 MB.

+ An internet connection. If you do not have an internet connection, for the instructions for an [offline installation](r-server-install-linux-offline.md).

+ A package manager (yum for RHEL systems, apt for Ubuntu, zypper for SLES systems)

+ Root or super user permissions

The following additional components are included in Setup and required for R Server.

* Microsoft R Open 3.3.3  
* Microsoft .NET Core 1.1 for Linux (required for mrsdeploy and MicrosoftML use cases)

![Download page on Visual Studio benefits page](./media/mlserver-install-older-versions.png)

### Unpack the distribution

Download the software to a writable directory, such as **/tmp**, unpack the distribution and then run the installation script.

The distribution includes one installer for Microsoft R Server. For a gzipped TAR file, you should unpack the file as follows (be sure you have downloaded the file to a writable directory, such as **/tmp**):

1. Log in as root or a user with super user privileges (`sudo su`).

2. Switch to the **/tmp** directory (assuming it's the download location).

3. Unpack the file:

   `[tmp] $ tar zxvf en_microsoft_r_server_910_for_linux_x64_10323878.tar.gz`

The distribution is unpacked into an `MRS91Linux` folder at the download location. The distribution includes the following files:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
|`install.sh` | Script for installing R Server. |
|`generate_mrs_parcel.sh` | Script for generating a parcel used for [installing R Server on CDH](r-server-install-cloudera.md). |
| `EULA.txt` | End user license agreements for each separately licensed component. |
| DEB folder | Contains Microsoft R packages for deployment on Ubuntu. |
| RPM folder | Contains Microsoft R packages for deployment on CentOS/RHEL and SUSE. |
| Parcel folder | Contains files used to generate a parcel for installation on CDH. |

MRS packages include an admin utility, core engine and function libraries, compute node and web node configuration options, platform packages, and machine learning.

> [!Important]
> Package names in the R Server distribution have changed in the 9.1 release. Instead of DeployrR-themed package names, the new names are aligned to base packages. If you have script or tooling for manual R Server package installation, be sure to note the name change.
>

### Run the MRS install script

R Server for Linux is deployed by running the install script with no parameters.

1. Log in as root or as a user with super user privileges (`sudo -s`). The following instructions assume root install.

2. Clean cached data so that the installer can get updated packages. 

   + On RHEL use [yum](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/sec-Working_with_Yum_Cache.html): `[root@localhost tmp] $ yum expire-cache`  
   + On Ubuntu use [apt-get](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto): `[root@localhost tmp] $ apt-get autoclean` 

3. Change to the `MRS91Linux` directory containing the installation script:

   `[root@localhost tmp] $ cd /tmp/MRS91Linux`

4. Run the script. To include the [pre-trained machine learning models for MicrosoftML](microsoftml-install-pretrained-models.md), append the `-m` switch. 

   `[root@localhost MRS91Linux] $ bash install.sh -m`

5. When prompted to accept the license terms for Microsoft R Open, click Enter to read the EULA, click **q** when you are finished reading, and then click **y** to accept the terms.

6. Repeat for the R Server license agreement: click Enter, click **q** when finished reading, click **y** to accept the terms.

   Installation begins immediately. Installer output shows the packages and location of the log file.

### Verify installation

1. List installed MRS packages:

   + On RHEL: `rpm -qa | grep microsoft` 
   + On Ubuntu: `apt list --installed | grep microsoft`  

2. Once you have a package name, you can obtain verbose version information. For example:

   + On RHEL: `$ rpm -qi microsoft-r-server-packages-9.1.x86_64`
   + On Ubuntu: `$ dpkg --status microsoft-r-server-packages-9.1.x86_64`  

Partial output is as follows (note version 9.1.0):

   ```
	  Name        : microsoft-r-server-packages-9.1     Relocations: /usr/lib64
	  Version     : 9.1.0                               Vendor: Microsoft
	  . . .
   ```

### Start Revo64

As another verification step, run the Revo64 program. By default, Revo64 is linked to the /usr/bin directory, available to any user who can log in to the machine:

1. From /Home or any other working directory:

   `[<path>] $ Revo64`

2. Run a RevoScaleR function, such as **rxSummary** on a dataset. Many sample datasets, such as the iris dataset, are ready to use because they are installed with the software:

   `> rxSummary(~., iris)`

   Output from the iris dataset should look similar to the following:

~~~~
        Rows Read: 150, Total Rows Processed: 150, Total Chunk Time: 0.001 seconds
        Computation time: 0.005 seconds.
        Call:
        rxSummary(formula = ~., data = iris)

        Summary Statistics Results for: ~.
        Data: iris
        Number of valid observations: 150

         Name         Mean     StdDev    Min Max ValidObs MissingObs

         setosa     50
         versicolor 50

~~~~

To quit the program, type `q()` at the command line with no arguments.

## Enable Remote Connections and Analytic Deployment

The server can be used as-is if you install and use an R IDE on the same box, but to benefit from the deployment and consumption of web services with Microsoft R Server, then you must configure R Server after installation to act as a deployment server and host analytic web services. Possible configurations are a [one-box setup](operationalize-r-server-one-box-config.md) or an [enterprise setup](operationalize-r-server-enterprise-config.md). Doing so also enables remote execution, allowing you to connect to R Server from an R Client workstation and execute code on the server.

## Unattended install options

You can perform a silent install to bypass prompts during setup. In /tmp/MRS91Linux, run the install script with the following parameters:

   `[root@localhost MRS91Linux] $ install.sh -a -s`

Additional flags are available, as follows:

flag | Option | Description
-----|--------|------------
 -a | --accept-eula | Accept all end user license agreements.
 -d | --download-mro |  Download microsoft r open for distribution to an offline system.
 -m | --models | Install Microsoft ML models.
 -r | --no-dotnet-core | Opt out of installing .NET Core (required for mrsdeploy and MicrosoftML)
 -s | --silent | Perform a silent, unattended install.
 -u | --unattended | Perform an unattended install.
 -h | --help | Print this help text.

## What's Installed with R Server

The Microsoft R Server setup installs the R base packages and a set of enhanced and proprietary R packages that support parallel processing, improved performance, and connectivity to data sources including SQL Server and Hadoop. In contrast with R Client, R Server supports much larger data sets and distributed workloads.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, telemetry data is collected during your usage of R Server. To turn this feature off, use the RevoScaleR package function `rxPrivacyControl(FALSE)`. To turn it back on, change the setting to `TRUE`.

## Next Steps

Review the best practices in [Manage your R Server for Linux installation](r-server-install-linux-manage-install.md) for instructions on how to set up a local package repository using MRAN or miniCRAN, change file ownership or permissions, set Revo64 as the de facto R script engine on your server.
