# Machine Learning Server in the Cloud

[Machine Learning Server](../what-is-microsoft-r-server.md), formerly known as Microsoft R Server, is the most broadly deployable enterprise-class analytics platform for R and Python. 

It is available in the cloud as follows:

+ [Machine Learning Server on Azure HDInsight](machine-learning-server-on-azure-hdinsight.md)

+ [Machine Learning Server as preconfigured Azure virtual machine on Linux](machine-learning-server-azure-vm-on-linux.md)

+ [Machine Learning Server as preconfigured Azure virtual machine on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/r/provision-the-r-server-only-sql-server-2016-enterprise-vm-on-azure)

+ [R Server on the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine](r-server-vm-data-science.md)
  
  Note: Machine Learning Server is coming soon on the Data Science VM.
