# Rollback to previous version

[!INCLUDE [retirement banner](~/includes/machine-learning-server-retirement.md)]

**Applies to:** R Server 9.1.0 on the Cloudera distribution of Apache Hadoop (CDH)

If you deployed and activated Microsoft R Server using a parcel and Custom Service Descriptor (CSD), you have the option of rolling back the active deployment in Cloudera Manager. You might do this if there is an older version of R Server in your cluster that you want to use instead.

> [!Note]
> You can have multiple versions of R Server in Cloudera, but only can be active at any given time.

1. In Cloudera Manager, click the Parcel icon to open the parcel list.

2. Find MRS and click **Deactivate**.

The parcel still exists, but R Server is not operational in the cluster.

The above steps only work for 9.1.0 and later. If you have an older version of R Server, see [Install R Server 9.0.1 on CDH](r-server-install-cloudera-901.md) for information about how it was installed.
