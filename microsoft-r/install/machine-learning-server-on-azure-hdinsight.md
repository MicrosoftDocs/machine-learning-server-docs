# Introducing Machine Learning Server on HDInsight

By running Machine Learning Server as a service on top of HDInsight, Machine Learning Server for HDInsight achieves unprecedented scale and performance by combining enterprise-scale R and Python analytics software with the power of Hadoop and Spark. Multi-threaded math libraries and transparent parallelization in Machine Learning Server means handling up to 1000x more data and up to 50x faster speeds than open source R—helping you train more accurate models for better predictions than previously possible. Plus, because Machine Learning Server is built to work with Python and the open source R language, all of your scripts can run without changes.
