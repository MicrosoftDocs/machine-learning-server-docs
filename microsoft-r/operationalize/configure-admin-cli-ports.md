# Update port values

**Applies to:  Machine Learning Server, Microsoft R Server**

You can update the ports numbers for the web node, compute node, or [deployr-rserve](https://github.com/Microsoft/deployr-rserve) (a forked version of RServe).

## Machine Learning Server 9.3 and later

In Machine Learning Server 9.3 and later, you can use `admin` extension of the Azure Command Line Interface ([Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)) to set up and manage your configuration, including updating the local 'admin' account password.

>[!Important]
>- This password is set while you are first configuring your nodes.
>- You do not need an Azure subscription to use this CLI. It is installed as part of Machine Learning Server and runs locally.  

To update port values:

1. On the machine hosting the node, launch a command-line window or terminal  with administrator (Windows) or root/sudo (Linux) privileges.

1. Run the command to update the port value(s), where `<Port>` should be replaced by the actual port number without the brackets.
   ```azurecli
   # With elevated privileges, run the following commands.
   # List current port values
   az ml admin port list

   # Update port values
   az ml admin port update --webnode <Port> --computenode <Port> --rserve <Port>
   ```

1. [Restart the node](configure-admin-cli-stop-start.md) for the change to go into effect. 

## Earlier versions: 9.0 - 9.2

To update port values:

1. Log in to the machine on which your web node or compute node is installed.

1. [Launch the administration utility](configure-admin-cli-launch.md) with administrator privileges (Windows) or root/sudo privileges (Linux).

1. From the main menu, choose the option **Change service ports**.

1. From the submenu, choose the port you want to update.

1. Enter the port number. 

   >The port number will be updated the next time the [service is restarted](configure-admin-cli-stop-start.md).
