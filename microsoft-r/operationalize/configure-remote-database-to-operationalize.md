# Configuring an SQL Server or PostgreSQL database for Machine Learning Server

[!INCLUDE [retirement banner](~/includes/machine-learning-server-retirement.md)]

**Applies to: Machine Learning Server, Microsoft R Server 9.x**

The operationalization feature for Machine Learning Server (and R Server) installs and uses a local SQLite database by default to store internal information. Later, you can update the configuration to use another database locally or remotely. This is useful when you want to use a remote database or when you have multiple web nodes. 

The database provides internal storage for the sessions, web services, snapshots, and other entities created as a result of operationalization. When a request comes in to a web node (for example, to consume a service), the web node connects to the databases, retrieves parameters for the service, and then sends the information to a compute node for execution.

> Consider the size of the machine hosting this database carefully to ensure that database performance does not degrade overall performance and throughput.

This feature uses a SQLite 3.7+ database by default, but can be configured to use:
+ SQL Server (Windows) Professional, Standard, or Express Version 2008 or greater
+ SQL Server (Linux)
+ Azure SQL DB
+ Azure Database for PostgreSQL
+ PostgreSQL 9.2 or greater (Linux)

> [!Important]
> Any data that was saved in the default local SQLite database will not be migrated to a different DB,  if you configure one.

<a name="sqlserver"></a>
<a name="postgresql"></a>

**To use a different local or remote database, do the following:**

>[!IMPORTANT] 
>These steps assume that you have already set up SQL Server or PostgreSQL as described for that product.
>
> Create this database and register it in the configuration file below BEFORE the service for the control node is started.

1.  On each web node, [stop the service](configure-admin-cli-stop-start.md).

1.  Update the database properties to point to the new database as follows:

    1. Open the configuration file, [\<web-node-install-path>](../operationalize/configure-find-admin-configuration-file.md)/appsettings.json. 

    1. Locate the `ConnectionStrings` property block.

    1. Within that property block, locate the type of database you want to set up.
       + For SQL Server or Azure SQL DB, look for `"sqlserver": {`.

       + For PostgreSQL or Azure Database for PostgreSQL, look for `"postgresql": {`.

    1. In the appropriate database section, enable that database type by adding the property `"Enabled": true,`. **You can only have one database enabled at a time.** 
       
       For example:
       ```
        "ConnectionStrings": {
                "sqlserver": {
                    "Enabled": true,
                    ...
       },
       ```

    1. Add the connection string.

       For SQL Server Database (**Integrated Security**), use your string properties that are similar to:
       ``` 
       "Connection":  "Data Source=<DB-SERVER-IP-OR-FQDN>\\<INSTANCE-NAME>;Initial Catalog=<DB-NAME>;Integrated Security=True;"
       ```

       For SQL Server Database (**SQL authentication**), use your string properties similar to: 
       ``` 
       "Connection":  "Data Source=<DB-SERVER-IP-OR-FQDN>\\<INSTANCE-NAME>;Initial Catalog=<DB-NAME>; Integrated Security=False; User Id=<USER-ID>;Password=<PASSWORD>;"
       ```

       For PostgreSQL Database, use your string properties:
       ``` 
       "Connection":  "User ID=<DB-USERNAME>;Password=<USER-PASSWORD>;Host=<DB-SERVER-IP-OR-FQDN>;Port=5432;Database=<DB-NAME>;Pooling=true;"
       ```       
    
    1. <a name="encrypt"></a>For better security, we recommend you encrypt the connection string for this database before adding the information to appsettings.json.
    
       1. [Encrypt the connection string](configure-admin-cli-encrypt-credentials.md).

       1. Copy the encrypted string returned by the administration utility into `"ConnectionStrings": {` property block and set `"Encrypted":` to `true`. For example:
            
       ```
        "ConnectionStrings": {
                "sqlserver": {
                    "Enabled": true,
                    "Encrypted": true,
                    "Connection": "eyJ0IjoiNzJFNDg5QUQ1RDQ4MEM1NURCMDRDMjM1MkQ1OTVEQ0I2RkQzQzE3QiIsInMiOiJFWkNhNUdJMUNSRFV0bXZHVEIxcmNRcmxXTE9QM2ZTOGtTWFVTRk5QSk9vVXRWVzRSTlh1THcvcDd0bCtQdFN3QVRFRjUvL2ZJMjB4K2xTME00VHRKZDdkcUhKb294aENOQURyZFY1KzZ0bUgzWG1TOWNVUkdwdjl3TGdTaUQ0Z0tUV0QrUDNZdEVMMCtrOStzdHB"
                },
                ...
       },
       ```       

    1. Save the changes you've made to appsettings.json.

1. Open the database port on the remote machine to the public IP of each web node as described in these articles: [SQL Server](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-windows-firewall-for-database-engine-access) | [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html)
         
1. [Start the web node](configure-admin-cli-stop-start.md) and the database is created upon restart.

1. [Run the diagnostic tests](configure-run-diagnostics.md) to ensure the connection can be made to your new database.
