# Microsoft R Server is now Microsoft Machine Learning Server

In September 2017, Microsoft R Server was released under the new name of **Microsoft Machine Learning Server**. In version 9.2.1, Machine Learning Server added support for the full data science lifecycle of Python-based analytics to its list of machine learning and AI capabilities enhancements. The R capabilities were also enhanced. In the 9.3 version, Machine Learning Server improves operationalization and deployment of web services containing R or Python code. In the 9.4 version, Machine Learning Server improved the installation experience on Spark.

Read the [What's new in this release](whats-new-in-machine-learning-server.md) to learn more.

## Building on our commitment to R

Microsoft continues its commitment and development in R -- not only in the latest Machine Learning Server release, but also in the newest [Microsoft R Client](r-client/what-is-microsoft-r-client.md) and [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com) releases.

## Upgrade to Machine Learning Server

Moving from R Server to Machine Learning Server is as easy as ever. The R analytics and web services you developed under R Server will continue to work under Machine Learning Server.

1. Follow [these instructions to install Machine Learning Server](install/machine-learning-server-install.md) on Windows, Linux, and Hadoop. 

1. Don't forget to [upgrade your web and compute nodes](operationalize/configure-start-for-administrators.md#configure-server-for-operationalization) if you are operationalizing your analytics.

>[!NOTE]
>Note that _Microsoft R Server 9.1 for Teradata_ was the last release and will not have a Machine Learning Server equivalent.
