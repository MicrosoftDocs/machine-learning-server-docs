# *microsoftml.categorical_hash*: Hashes and converts a text column into categories





## Usage



```
microsoftml.categorical_hash(cols: [str, dict, list],
    hash_bits: int = 16, seed: int = 314489979,
    ordered: bool = True, invert_hash: int = 0,
    output_kind: ['Bag', 'Ind', 'Key', 'Bin'] = 'Bag', **kargs)
```





## Description

Categorical hash transform that can be performed on data before
training a model.


## Details

`categorical_hash` converts a categorical value into an indicator
array by hashing the value and using the hash as an index in the bag. If
the input column is a vector, a single indicator bag is returned for it.
`categorical_hash` does not currently support handling factor data.


## Arguments


### cols

A character string or list of variable names to transform. If
`dict`, the keys represent the names of new variables to be created.


### hash_bits

An integer specifying the number of bits to hash into.
Must be between 1 and 30, inclusive. The default value is 16.


### seed

An integer specifying the hashing seed. The default value is
314489979.


### ordered

`True` to include the position of each term in the
hash. Otherwise, `False`. The default value is `True`.


### invert_hash

An integer specifying the limit on the number of keys
that can be used to generate the slot name. `0` means no invert
hashing; `-1` means no limit. While a zero value gives better
performance, a non-zero value is needed to get meaningful coefficient names.
The default value is `0`.


### output_kind

A character string that specifies the kind
of output kind.

* `"Bag"`: Outputs a multi-set vector. If the input column is a vector of categories, the output contains one vector, where the value in each slot is the number of occurrences of the category in the input vector. If the input column contains a single category, the indicator vector and the bag vector are equivalent 

* `"Ind"`: Outputs an indicator vector. The input column is a vector of categories, and the output contains one indicator vector per slot in the input column. 

* `"Key`: Outputs an index. The output is an integer ID (between 1 and the number of categories in the dictionary) of the category. 

* `"Bin`: Outputs a vector which is the binary representation of the category. 

The default value is `"Bag"`.


### kargs

Additional arguments sent to the compute engine.


## Returns

an object defining the transform.
