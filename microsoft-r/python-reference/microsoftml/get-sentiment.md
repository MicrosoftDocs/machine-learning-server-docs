customer_reviews = pandas.DataFrame(data=dict(review=[
            "I really did not like the taste of it",
            "It was surprisingly quite good!",
            "I will never ever ever go to that place again!!"]))
            
# Get the sentiment scores
sentiment_scores = rx_featurize(
    data=customer_reviews,
    ml_transforms=[get_sentiment(cols=dict(scores="review"))])
    
# Let's translate the score to something more meaningful
sentiment_scores["eval"] = sentiment_scores.scores.apply(
