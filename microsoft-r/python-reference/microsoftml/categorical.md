# *microsoftml.categorical*: Converts a text column into categories





## Usage



```
microsoftml.categorical(cols: [str, dict, list], output_kind: ['Bag', 'Ind',
    'Key', 'Bin'] = 'Ind', max_num_terms: int = 1000000,
    terms: int = None, sort: ['Occurrence', 'Value'] = 'Occurrence',
    text_key_values: bool = False, **kargs)
```





## Description

Categorical transform that can be performed on data before
training a model.


## Details

The `categorical` transform passes through a data set, operating
on text columns, to build a dictionary of categories. For each row,
the entire text string appearing in the input column is defined as a
category. The output of the categorical transform is an indicator vector.
Each slot in this vector corresponds to a category in the dictionary, so
its length is the size of the built dictionary. The categorical transform
can be applied to one or more columns, in which case it builds a separate
dictionary for each column that it is applied to.

`categorical` is not currently supported to handle factor data.


## Arguments


### cols

A character string or list of variable names to transform. If
`dict`, the keys represent the names of new variables to be created.


### output_kind

A character string that specifies the kind of output kind.

* `"Bag"`: Outputs a multi-set vector. If the input column is a vector of categories, the output contains one vector, where the value in each slot is the number of occurrences of the category in the input vector. If the input column contains a single category, the indicator vector and the bag vector are equivalent 

* `"Ind"`: Outputs an indicator vector. The input column is a vector of categories, and the output contains one indicator vector per slot in the input column. 

* `"Key"`: Outputs an index. The output is an integer ID (between 1 and the number of categories in the dictionary) of the category. 

* `"Bin"`: Outputs a vector which is the binary representation of the category. 

The default value is `"Ind"`.


### max_num_terms

An integer that specifies the maximum number of
categories to include in the dictionary. The default value is 1000000.


### terms

Optional character vector of terms or categories.


### sort

A character string that specifies the sorting criteria.

* `"Occurrence"`: Sort categories by occurrences. Most frequent is first. 

* `"Value"`: Sort categories by values. 


### text_key_values

Whether key value metadata should be text, regardless of the actual input type.


### kargs

Additional arguments sent to compute engine.


## Returns

An object defining the transform.
