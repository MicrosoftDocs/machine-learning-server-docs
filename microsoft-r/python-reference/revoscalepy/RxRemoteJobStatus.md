## Description

This enumeration represents the execution status of a remote Python job.  The enumeration is returned from the
rx_get_job_status method and will indicate the current status of the job.  The enumeration has the following
values indicating job status:

*FINISHED* - The job has run to a successful completion

*FAILED* - The job has failed

*CANCELED* - The job was canceled before it could run to successful completion by using *rx_cancel_job*

*UNDETERMINED* - The job’s status could not be determined, typically meaning it has been executed on the server
and the job has already been cleaned up by calling *rx_get_job_results* or *rx_cleanup_jobs*

*RUNNING* - The distributed computing job is currently executing on the server

*QUEUED* - The distributed computing job is currently awaiting execution on the server

## Example



```
from revoscalepy import RxInSqlServer
from revoscalepy import rx_exec
from revoscalepy import RxRemoteJobStatus
from revoscalepy import rx_get_job_status
from revoscalepy import rx_wait_for_job

connection_string = 'Driver=SQL Server;Server=.;Database=RevoTestDb;Trusted_Connection=True;'

# Setting wait to False allows the job to be run asynchronously
# Setting console_output to True allows us to get the console output of the distributed computing job
compute_context = RxInSqlServer(connection_string=connection_string,
                                num_tasks=1,
                                console_output=True,
                                wait=False)

def hello_from_sql():
    import time
    print('Hello from SQL server')
    time.sleep(3)
    return 'We just ran Python code asynchronously on a SQL server!'

job = rx_exec(function=hello_from_sql, compute_context=compute_context)

# Poll initial status
status = rx_get_job_status(job)

print(status)

if status == RxRemoteJobStatus.RUNNING or status == RxRemoteJobStatus.QUEUED :
# Wait for the job to finish or fail whatever the case may be
rx_wait_for_job(job)

# Poll final status
status = rx_get_job_status(job)

print(status)
