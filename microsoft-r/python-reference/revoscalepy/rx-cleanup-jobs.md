# rx_cleanup_jobs


 


## Usage



```
revoscalepy.rx_cleanup_jobs(job_info_list: typing.Union[revoscalepy.computecontext.RxRemoteJob.RxRemoteJob,
    list], force: bool = False, verbose: bool = True)
```





## Description

Removes the artifacts for the specified jobs.

If *job_info_list* is a *RxRemoteJob* object, *rx_cleanup_jobs* attempts to remove the artifacts. However, if
the job has successfully completed and *force* is *False*, *rx_cleanup_jobs* issues a warning saying to either
set *force=True* or use *rx_get_job_results* to get the results and delete the artifacts.

If *job_info_list* is a list of jobs, *rx_cleanup_jobs* attempts to apply the cleanup rules for a single job to
each element in the list.


## Arguments


### job_info_list

The jobs for which to remove the artifacts, this can be a list of jobs or a single job


### force

*True* indicates the cleanup should happen regardless of whether or not the job status can be determined
and job results have already been retrieved. *False* indicates that the should be cleaned up by calling
*rx_get_job_results* or the job should have completed unsuccessfully (such as by using rx_cancel_job).


### verbose

If *True*, will print the directories/records being deleted.


## Returns

This function does not return a value
