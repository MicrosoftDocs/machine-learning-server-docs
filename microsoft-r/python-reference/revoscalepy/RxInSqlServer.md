# RxInSqlServer


 



```
revoscalepy.RxInSqlServer(connection_string: str, num_tasks: int = 1,
    auto_cleanup: bool = True, console_output: bool = None,
    execution_timeout_seconds: int = None, wait: bool = True,
    packages_to_load: list = None)
```





## Description

Creates a compute context for running revoscalepy analyses inside Microsoft SQL Server.
Currently only supported in Windows.


## Arguments


### connection_string

An ODBC connection string used to connect to the
Microsoft SQL Server database.


### num_tasks

Number of tasks (processes) to run for each computation.
This is the maximum number of tasks that will be used; SQL Server may start
fewer processes if there is not enough data, if too many resources are
already being used by other jobs, or if num_tasks exceeds the MAXDOP
(maximum degree of parallelism) configuration option in SQL Server. Each of
the tasks is given data in parallel, and does computations in parallel, and
so computation time may decrease as num_tasks increases. However, that may
not always be the case, and computation time may even increase if too many
tasks are competing for machine resources. Note that
RxOptions.set_option(“NumCoresToUse”, n) controls how many cores (actually, threads) are
used in parallel within each process, and there is a trade-off between
NumCoresToUse and NumTasks that depends upon the specific algorithm, the
type of data, the hardware, and the other jobs that are running.


### wait

Bool value, if True, the job will be blocking and will not
return until it has completed or has failed. If False, the job will be
non-blocking and return immediately, allowing you to continue running other
Python code. The client connection with SQL Server must be maintained while
the job is running, even in non-blocking mode.


### console_output

Bool value, if True, causes the standard output
of the Python process started by SQL Server to be printed to the user console.
This value may be overwritten by passing a non-None bool value to the
consoleOutput argument provided in rx_exec and rx_get_job_results.


### auto_cleanup

Bool value, if True, the default behavior is to
clean up the temporary computational artifacts and delete the result
objects upon retrieval. If False, then the computational results are not
deleted, and the results may be acquired using rx_get_job_results, and the
output via rx_get_job_output until the rx_cleanup_jobs is used to delete the
results and other artifacts. Leaving this flag set to False can result in
accumulation of compute artifacts which you may eventually need to delete
before they fill up your hard drive.


### execution_timeout_seconds

Integer value, defaults to 0 which means
infinite wait.


### packages_to_load

Optional list of strings specifying additional
packages to be loaded on the nodes when jobs are run in this compute context.

## Example



```
## Not run:
from revoscalepy import RxSqlServerData, RxInSqlServer, rx_lin_mod

connection_string="Driver=SQL Server;Server=.;Database=RevoTestDB;Trusted_Connection=True"

cc = RxInSqlServer(
    connection_string = connection_string,
    num_tasks = 1,
    auto_cleanup = False,
    console_output = True,
    execution_timeout_seconds = 0,
    wait = True
    )

query="select top 100 [ArrDelay],[CRSDepTime],[DayOfWeek] FROM airlinedemosmall"
data_source = RxSqlServerData(
    sql_query = "select top 100 * from airlinedemosmall",
    connection_string = connection_string,
    column_info = {
        "ArrDelay" : { "type" : "integer" },
        "DayOfWeek" : {
            "type" : "factor",
            "levels" : [ "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday" ]
        }
    })

formula = "ArrDelay ~ CRSDepTime + DayOfWeek"
lin_mod = rx_lin_mod(formula, data = data_source, compute_context = cc)
print(lin_mod)
## End(Not run)
