 # mutualInformation: Feature Selection Mutual Information Mode 
 ## Description

Mutual information mode of feature selection used in the feature selection
transform [selectFeatures](selectFeatures.md).


 ## Usage

```   
  mutualInformation(numFeaturesToKeep = 1000, numBins = 256, ...)

```

 ## Arguments



 ### `numFeaturesToKeep`
 If the number of features to keep is specified to be `n`, the transform picks the `n` features that have the highest mutual information with the dependent variable. The default value is 1000. 



 ### `numBins`
 Maximum number of bins for numerical values. Powers of 2 are recommended. The default value is 256. 



 ### ` ...`
 Additional arguments to be passed directly to the Microsoft Compute Engine. 



 ## Details

The mutual information of two random variables `X` and `Y` is a
measure of the mutual dependence between the variables. Formally, the
mutual information can be written as:

`I(X;Y) = E[log(p(x,y)) - log(p(x)) - log(p(y))]`

where the expectation is taken over the joint distribution of `X` and
`Y`. Here `p(x,y)` is the joint probability density function of
`X` and `Y`, `p(x)` and `p(y)` are the marginal
probability density functions of `X` and `Y` respectively. In
general, a higher mutual information between the dependent variable (or
label) and an independent varialbe (or feature) means that the label has
higher mutual dependence over that feature.

The mutual information feature selection mode selects the features based on
the mutual information. It keeps the top `numFeaturesToKeep` features
with the largest mutual information with the label.


 ## Value

a character string defining the mode.
