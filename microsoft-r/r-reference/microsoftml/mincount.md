 # minCount: Feature Selection Count Mode 
 ## Description

Count mode of feature selection used in the feature selection transform
[selectFeatures](selectFeatures.md).


 ## Usage

```   
  minCount(count = 1, ...)

```

 ## Arguments



 ### `count`
 The threshold for count based feature selection. A feature is selected if and only if at least `count` examples have non-default value in the feature. The default value is 1. 



 ### ` ...`
 Additional arguments to be passed directly to the Microsoft Compute Engine. 



 ## Details

When using the count mode in feature selection transform, a feature is
selected if the number of examples have at least the specified count
examples of non-default values in the feature. The count mode feature
selection transform is very useful when applied together with a categorical
hash transform (see also, [categoricalHash](categoricalHash.md). The count feature
selection can remove those features generated by hash transform that have no
data in the examples.


 ## Value

A character string defining the count mode.
