 # readNews: Read R or Package NEWS Files 
 ## Description
 Read the R NEWS file or a package's NEWS or NEWS.Rd file. 
 
 ## Usage

```   
  readNews(package)
 
```
 
 ## Arguments

   
    
 ### package
 a character string specifying the package for which you'd like to read the  news. If missing, the R NEWS is displayed. 
  
 
 
 
 ## Details
 
The R NEWS file is displayed using `RShowDoc` or `file.show`, depending
on whether the system appears capable of launching a browser. Similarly, package NEWS.Rd
files are displayed using `browseURL` or `file.show`.

This function should not be confused with readNEWS in the **tools** package, 
which performs a different kind of reading.
 
 
 ## Value
 
`NULL` is returned invisibly.
