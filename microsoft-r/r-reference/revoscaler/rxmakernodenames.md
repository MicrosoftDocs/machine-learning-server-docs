 # rxMakeRNodeNames:  Converts valid computer names into valid R variable names.  
 ## Description

Converts valid computer names into valid R variable names.  Should only be used when you want to guarantee that host 
names are usable as variable names.



 ## Usage

```   
  rxMakeRNodeNames( nodeNames )

```


 ## Arguments



 ### `nodeNames`
 character vector of node names to be converted. 




 ## Details

rxMakeRNodeNames will preform the following transformations on each element of the character vector passed:


1 
 Perform `toupper` on the name.

1 
 Remove all white space from the name.

1 
 If one exists, removes the first dot and all characters following it from the name.  (This has the effect of stripping 
the domain name off, if one exists.)

1 
 Changes any '-' (dash) characters to '_' (underscore) characters so that node names used as variables do not have to be quoted.



The names returned by this function are valid R names, that is, symbols, but they may no longer be valid computer node names. Do **not**
use these names, or this function, in any context where the name may be used to query or control the actual computer; use the original computer
name for that.  This function is intended to be used only to generate R variable names for processing or storing distributed computing results
from the associated computer. Note also that once a host name has been converted into a guaranteed acceptable R variable name, 
it is impossible to guarantee the reverse conversion.
