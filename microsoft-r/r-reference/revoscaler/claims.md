 # claims: Auto Insurance Claims Data 
 ## Description

Observations on automobile insurance claims.


 ## Format

An .xdf file with 127 observations on the following 6 variables:


### `RowNum`
integer containing the row numbers.


### `age`
driver's age (stored as a factor).


### `car.age`
car's age (stored as a factor).


### `type`
type of claim (stored as a factor).


### `cost`
cost of each claim (stored as a float32).


### `number`
number of claims per driver (stored as a float32).





 ## Details

The claims.xdf file is an .xdf version of the `claims`
data frame used in the White Book (*Statistical Models in S*). The
claims.txt file is a comma-separated text version of the same data. The
file claimsExtra.txt is a simulated data set with four additional
observations of the original six variables.
