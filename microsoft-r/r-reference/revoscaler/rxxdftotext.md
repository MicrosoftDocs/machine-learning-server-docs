 # rxXdfToText: Export .xdf File to Delimited Text File 
 ## Description

Write .xdf file content to a delimited text file. `rxDataStep` recommended.


 ## Usage

```   
  rxXdfToText(inFile, outFile, varsToKeep = NULL, 
        varsToDrop = NULL, rowSelection = NULL, 
        transforms = NULL, transformObjects = NULL,
        transformFunc = NULL, transformVars = NULL,  
        transformPackages = NULL, transformEnvir = NULL, 
        overwrite = FALSE, sep = ",", quote = TRUE, na = "NA", 
        eol = "\n", col.names = TRUE,
        blocksPerRead = rxGetOption("blocksPerRead"),
        reportProgress = rxGetOption("reportProgress"), ...) 

```

 ## Arguments



 ### `inFile`
 either an RxXdfData object or a character string specifying the input .xdf file. 



 ### `outFile`
 character string specifying the output delimited text file. 



 ### `varsToKeep`
 character vector of variable names to include when reading from `inFile`. If `NULL`, argument is ignored. Cannot be used with `varsToDrop`. 



 ### `varsToDrop`
 character vector of variable names to exclude when reading from `inFile`. If `NULL`, argument is ignored. Cannot be used with `varsToKeep`. 



 ### `rowSelection`
 name of a logical variable in the data set (in quotes) or a logical expression using variables in the data set to specify row selection.  For example, `rowSelection = "old"` will use only observations in which the value of the variable `old` is `TRUE`.  `rowSelection = (age > 20) & (age < 65) & (log(income) > 10)` will use only observations in which the value of the `age` variable is between 20 and 65 and the value of the `log` of the `income` variable is greater than 10.  The row selection is performed after processing any data transformations  (see the arguments `transforms` or `transformFunc`). As with all expressions, `rowSelection` can be defined outside of the function  call using the expression function. 



 ### `transforms`
 an expression of the form `list(name = expression, ...)` representing the first round of variable transformations. As with all expressions, `transforms` (or `rowSelection`)  can be defined outside of the function call using the expression function. 



 ### `transformObjects`
 a named list containing objects that can be referenced by `transforms`, `transformsFunc`, and `rowSelection`. 



 ### `transformFunc`
 variable transformation function. See [rxTransform](rxTransform.md) for details. 



 ### `transformVars`
 character vector of input data set variables needed for the transformation function. See [rxTransform](rxTransform.md) for details. 



 ### `transformPackages`
 character vector specifying additional R packages (outside of those specified in `rxGetOption("transformPackages")`) to be made available and  preloaded for use in variable transformation functions, both those explicitly defined in **RevoScaleR** functions via their `transforms` and `transformFunc` arguments and those  defined implicitly via their `formula` or `rowSelection` arguments.  The `transformPackages` argument may also be `NULL`,  indicating that no packages outside `rxGetOption("transformPackages")` will be preloaded. 



 ### `transformEnvir`
 user-defined environment to serve as a parent to  all environments developed internally and used for variable data transformation. If `transformEnvir = NULL`, a new "hash" environment with parent `baseenv()` is used instead. 



 ### `overwrite`
 logical value. If `TRUE`, the existing `outFile` will be overwritten. 



 ### `sep`
 character(s) specifying the separator between columns. 



 ### `quote`
 logical value or numeric vector. If `TRUE`, any character or factor columns will be surrounded by double quotes. If a numeric vector, its elements are taken as the indices of columns to quote. In both cases, row and column names are quoted if they are written. If `FALSE`, nothing is quoted. 



 ### `na`
 character string to use for missing values in the data. 



 ### `eol`
 character(s) to print at the end of each line (row). For example, `eol = "\r\n"` will produce Windows' line endings on a Unix-alike OS, and `eol = "\r"` will produce files as expected by Mac OS Excel 2004. 



 ### `col.names`
 a logical value indicating whether the column names in the `inFile` should be written as the first row in the output text file. 



 ### `blocksPerRead`
 number of blocks to read for each chunk of data read from the data source. 



 ### `reportProgress`
 integer value with options:  
*   `0`: no progress is reported. 
*   `1`: the number of processed rows is printed and updated. 
*   `2`: rows processed and timings are reported. 
*   `3`: rows processed and all timings are reported. 




 ### ` ...`
 additional arguments passed to the write.table function. 



 ## Details

For most purposes, the more general [rxDataStep](rxDataStep.md) is preferred for writing to text files.


 ## Value

An [RxTextData](RxTextData.md) object representing the output text file.

 ## Examples

 ```

  sampleDataDir <- rxGetOption("sampleDataDir")
  censusXdfFile <- file.path(rxGetOption("sampleDataDir"), "CensusWorkers.xdf")

  # Write all data in a text file
  censusCsvFile <- file.path(tempdir(), "CensusWorkers.csv")
  rxXdfToText(inFile = censusXdfFile, outFile = censusCsvFile, overwrite = TRUE)

  # Alternatively, use rxDataStep
  rxDataStep(inData = censusXdfFile, outFile = censusCsvFile, overwrite = TRUE)

  # Write subset of transformed data in a text file
  censusSubsetCsvFile <- file.path(tempdir(), "CensusSubset.csv")
  rxXdfToText(inFile = censusXdfFile, outFile = censusSubsetCsvFile,
              varsToKeep = c("age", "incwage"),
              rowSelection = age < 40,
              transforms = list(logIncwage = log1p(incwage), incwage = NULL),
              overwrite = TRUE)

  # Again, this can be done using rxDataStep
  rxDataStep(inData = censusXdfFile, outFile = censusSubsetCsvFile,
              varsToKeep = c("age", "incwage"),
              rowSelection = age < 40,
              transforms = list(logIncwage = log1p(incwage), incwage = NULL),
              overwrite = TRUE)
  # Clean-up
  file.remove(censusCsvFile)
  file.remove(censusSubsetCsvFile)          
```
