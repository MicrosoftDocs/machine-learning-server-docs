 ## Details

The 5% 2000 U.S. Census sample is a stratified 5% sample of households,
produced and maintained by the Minnesota Population Center at the University
of Minnesota as part of the *Integrated Public Use Microdata Series*, or
IPUMS. The full data set contains 14,583,731 rows with 265 variables. This
data was converted to the .xdf format, using  the SPSS dictionary
provided on the IPUMS web site to obtain variable labels, value labels, and
value codes. The subsample was taken using the following rowSelection:
`(age >= 20) & (age <= 65) & (wkswork1 > 20) &
``(stateicp == "Connecticut" | stateicp == "Washington" | stateicp == "Indiana")`
