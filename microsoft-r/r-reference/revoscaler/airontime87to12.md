 # AirOnTime87to12: Airline On-Time Performance Data 
 ## Description

Airline on-time performance data from 1987 to 2012.


 ## Format

AirOnTime87to12 is an .xdf file with 148617414 observations on the following 29 variables:
AirOnTime7Pct is a 7 percent subsample with a subset of 9 variables: ArrDelay, ArrDel15,
CRSDepTime, DayOfWeek, DepDelay, Dest, Origin, UniqueCarrier, Year.


### `Year`
year of flight (stored as integer).


### `Month`
month of the flight(stored as integer).


### `DayofMonth`
day of the month (1 to 31) (stored as integer).


### `DayOfWeek`
day of the week (stored as factor).


### `FlightDate`
flight date (stored as Date).


### `UniqueCarrier`
unique carrier code (stored as factor).  When the same code has been used by multiple carriers, a numeric suffix is used for earlier users, for example, PA, PA(1), PA(2).


### `TailNum`
plane's tail number (stored as factor).


### `FlightNum`
flight number (stored as factor).


### `OriginAirportID`
originating airport, airport ID (stored as factor).  An identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airport.  Use  this field for airport analysis across a range of years because an airport can  change its airport code and airport codes can be reused.


### `Origin`
originating airport (stored as factor).


### `OriginState`
originating airport, state code (stored as factor).


### `DestAirportID`
destination airport, airport ID (stored as factor).  An identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airport.  Use  this field for airport analysis across a range of years because an airport can  change its airport code and airport codes can be reused.


### `Dest`
destination airport (stored as factor).


### `DestState`
destination airport, state code (stored as factor).


### `CRSDepTime`
scheduled local departure time (stored as decimal float, for example, 12:45 is stored as 12.75).


### `DepTime`
actual local departure time (stored as decimal float, for example, 12:45 is stored as 12.75).


### `DepDelay`
difference in minutes between scheduled and actual departure time (stored as integer). Early departures show negative numbers.


### `DepDelayMinutes`
difference in minutes between scheduled and actual departure time (stored as integer). Early departures set to 0.


### `DepDel15`
departure delay indicator, 15 minutes or more (stored as logical).


### `DepDelayGroups`
departure delay intervals, every 15 minutes from < -15 to > 180 (stored as a factor).


### `TaxiOut`
taxi time from departure from the gate to wheels off, in minutes (stored as integer).


### `WheelsOff`
wheels off time in local time (stored as decimal float, for example, 12:45 is stored as 12.75).


### `WheelsOn`
wheels on time in local time (stored as decimal float, for example, 12:45 is stored as 12.75).


### `TaxiIn`
taxi in time in minutes (stored as integer).


### `CRSArrTime`
scheduled arrival in local time (stored as decimal float, for example, 12:45 is stored as 12.75).


### `ArrTime`
actual arrival time in local time (stored as decimal float, for example, 12:45 is stored as 12.75).


### `ArrDelay`
difference in minutes between scheduled and   actual arrival time (stored as integer). Early arrivals show negative numbers.


### `ArrDelayMinutes`
difference in minutes between scheduled and   actual arrival time (stored as integer). Early arrivals set to 0.


### `ArrDel15`
arrival delay indicator, 15 minutes or more  (stored as logical).


### `ArrDelayGroups`
arrival delay intervals, every 15 minutes from < -15 to > 180 (stored as a factor).


### `Cancelled`
canceled flight indicator (stored as logical).


### `CancellationCode`
cancellation code, if applicable (stored as factor).


### `Diverted`
diverted flight indicator(stored as logical).


### `CRSElapsedTime`
scheduled elapsed time of flight, in minutes (stored as integer).


### `ActualElapsedTime`
actual elapsed time of flight, in minutes (stored as integer).


### `AirTime`
flight time, in minutes (stored as integer).


### `Flights`
number of flights (stored as integer).


### `Distance`
distance between airports in miles (stored as integer).


### `DistanceGroup`
distance intervals, every 250 miles, for flight segment (stored as a factor).


### `CarrierDelay`
delay, in minutes, attributable to the carrier (stored as integer).


### `WeatherDelay`
delay, in minutes, attributable to weather factors (stored as integer).


### `NASDelay`
delay, in minutes, attributable to the National Aviation System (stored as integer).


### `SecurityDelay`
delay, in minutes, attributable to security factors (stored as integer).


### `LateAircraftDelay`
delay, in minutes, attributable to late-arriving aircraft (stored as integer).


### `MonthsSince198710`
number of months since October 1987 (store as integer).


### `DaysSince19871001`
number of days since 1 October 1987 (store as integer).
