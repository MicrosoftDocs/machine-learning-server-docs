 # prune.rxDTree: Pruning an rxDTree Decision Tree 
 ## Description

Prune a decision tree created by `rxDTree` and return the smaller tree.


 ## Usage

```   

  prune.rxDTree(tree, cp,   ...  )


```

 ## Arguments



 ### `tree`
  object returned from a call to `rxDTree`. 


 ### `cp`
  a complexity parameter specifying the complexity at which to prune the tree. Generally, you should examine the `cptable` component of the `tree` object to determine a suitable value for `cp`. 


 ### ` ...`
  additional arguments to be passed to other methods. (There are, in fact, no other methods called by `prune.rxDTree`.) 





 ## Details

The `prune.rxDTree` function can be used as a `prune` method for objects of
class `rxDTree`, provided the **rpart** package is attached prior to attaching 
**RevoScaleR**.


 ## Value

an object of class `"rxDTree"` representing the pruned tree. 
It is a list with components similar to those of class `"rpart"` with the following distinctions:


* `where` -  A vector of integers indicating the node to which each point is allocated. This information is always returned if the data source is a data frame. If the data source is not a data frame and `outFile` is specified that is, not `NULL`, the node indices are written/appended to the specified file with a column name as defined by `outColName`.



For other components, see rpart.object for details.
