# Authentication and Authorization

DeployR ships with security providers for the following enterprise security solutions:

-   [Basic Authentication](#basic-authentication)
-   [LDAP / LDAP-S Authentication](#ldap)
-   [Active Directory Services](#active-directory-authentication)
-   [PAM Authentication Services](#pam-authentication)
-   [CA Single Sign-On](#ca-single-sign-on-siteminder-pre-authentication)
-   [R Session Process Controls](#r-session-process-controls)

The DeployR security model is sufficiently flexible that it can work with multiple enterprise security solutions at the same time. If two or more enterprise security solutions are active, then user credentials are evaluated by each of the DeployR security providers in the order indicated in preceding list. If a security provider, at any depth in the provider-chain, establishes that the credentials are valid, then the login call succeeds. If the user credentials are not validated by any of the security providers in the provider-chain, then the login call fails.

When DeployR processes a user login, there are two key steps involved:

1.  Credentials must be authenticated
2.  Access privileges must be determined

DeployR access privileges are determined by the roles assigned to a user. In the case of basic authentication, an administrator simply assigns roles to a user within the DeployR Administration Console.

>**Learn More!** For information on how to manage user accounts as well as how to use roles as a means to assign access privileges to a user or to restrict access to individual R scripts, refer to the [Administration Console Help](../what-is-operationalization.md).

When you integrate with an external enterprise security solution, you want access privileges to be inherited from the external system. This is achieved with simple mappings in the DeployR configuration properties, which link external groups to internal roles.

## Basic Authentication

By default, the Basic Authentication security provider is enabled. The Basic Authentication provider is enabled by default and there are no additional security configuration properties for this provider.

If you enable [Active Directory Services](#active-directory-authentication) or [CA Single Sign-On (SiteMinder)](#ca-single-sign-on-siteminder-pre-authentication), Basic Authentication is automatically disabled and you will no longer be able to login with the default users `admin` and `testuser`. For [PAM Authentication Services](#pam-authentication) and [LDAP](#ldap) scenarios, basic authentication remains enabled even with PAM or LDAP enabled.

## LDAP / LDAP-S Authentication

By default, the **LDAP** security provider is disabled. To enable LDAP authentication support, you must update the relevant properties in your DeployR external configuration file. The values you assign to these properties should match the configuration of your LDAP Directory Information Tree (DIT).

The standard protocol for reading data from and writing data to Active Directory (AD) domain controllers (DCs) is LDAP. AD LDAP traffic is unsecured by default, which makes it possible to use network-monitoring software to view the LDAP traffic between clients and DCs. You can make LDAP traffic confidential and secure using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology. This combination is referred to as LDAP over SSL (or LDAP-S). To ensure that no one else can read the traffic, SSL/TLS establishes an encrypted tunnel between an LDAP client and a DC. [Learn more about enabling SSL/TLS for DeployR.](../operationalize/configure-https.md)

Reasons for enabling LDAP-S include:
+ Organizational security policies typically require that all client/server communication is encrypted.
+ Applications use simple BIND to transport credentials and authenticate against a DC. As simple BIND exposes the usersâ€™ credentials in clear text, using SSL/TLS to encrypt the authentication session is strongly recommended.
+ Use of proxy binding or password change over LDAP, which requires LDAP-S. [Bind to an AD LDS instance Through a Proxy Object](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc794922(v=ws.10))
+ Applications that integrate with LDAP servers (such as Active Directory or Active Directory Domain Controllers) might require encrypted LDAP communications.

>Basic authentication remains enabled even with LDAP enabled.

**To enable LDAP or LDAP-S:** 

The LDAP and Active Directory security providers are one and the same, but their [configuration properties](#ldap-active-directory-configuration-properties) differ. As such, you may enable the LDAP provider or the Active Directory provider, but not both at the same time.
Accordingly, to enable do the following:

1. Set `grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.active=true`
2. Uncomment only the LDAP properties 
3. Make sure the Active Directory section is commented out **except** for this line which should be **set to false**.    
   ```
   grails.plugin.springsecurity.ad.active=false
   ```
4. For each property, use the value matching your configuration. For more information, see the complete list of LDAP [configuration properties](#ldap-active-directory-configuration-properties).

   + For LDAP, set `grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.context.server` to the LDAP server URL, such as `'ldap://localhost:389/'`.

   + For LDAPS, set `grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.context.server` to the LDAP-S server URL, such as `'ldaps://localhost:636/'`.

   For example:
    ```
    /*
     * DeployR LDAP Authentication Configuration Properties
     *
     * To enable LDAP authentication uncomment the following properties and
     * set grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.active=true and
     * provide property values matching your LDAP DIT:
     */
     grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.active=false
     /*
    grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.context.managerDn = 'dc=example,dc=com'
    grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.context.managerPassword = 'secret'

    // LDAP
    grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.context.server = 'ldap://localhost:389/'

    grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.context.anonymousReadOnly = true
    grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.search.base = 'ou=people,dc=example,dc=com'
    grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.search.searchSubtree = true
    grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.authorities.groupSearchFilter = 'member={0}'
    grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.authorities.retrieveGroupRoles = true
    grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.authorities.groupSearchBase = 'ou=group,dc=example,dc=com'
    grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.authorities.defaultRole = "ROLE_BASIC_USER"

    // Optionally, specify LDAP password encryption algorithm: MD5, SHA-256
    // grails.plugin.springsecurity.password.algorithm = 'xxx'

    // deployr.security.ldap.user.properties.map
    // Allows you to map LDAP user property names to DeployR user property names:
    deployr.security.ldap.user.properties.map = ['displayName':'cn',
                                                 'email':'mail',
                                                 'uid' : 'uidNumber',
                                                 'gid' : 'gidNumber']

    // deployr.security.ldap.roles.map property
    // Allows you to map between LDAP group names to DeployR role names.
    // NOTE: LDAP group names can be defined on the LDAP server using any mix of 
    // upper and lower case, such as finance, Finance or FINANCE. However, in the mapping, 
    // the LDAP group name must have ROLE_ as a prefix and be fully capitalized. 
    // For example, an LDAP group named "finance" should appear as ROLE_FINANCE. 
    deployr.security.ldap.roles.map = ['ROLE_FINANCE':'ROLE_BASIC_USER',
                                       'ROLE_ENGINEERING':'ROLE_POWER_USER']
    */
    ```

>If you have enabled PAM authentication as part of the required steps for enabling R Session Process Controls, then please continue with your configuration using [these steps](#r-session-process-controls).

## Active Directory Authentication

By default, the Active Directory security provider is disabled. To enable Active Directory authentication support you must update the relevant properties in your DeployR external configuration file. The values you assign to these properties should match the configuration of your Active Directory Directory Information Tree (DIT).

**To enable Active Directory:** 

The LDAP and Active Directory security providers are one and the same, but their [configuration properties](#ldap-active-directory-configuration-properties) differ. As such, you may enable the LDAP provider or the Active Directory provider, but not both at the same time.
Accordingly, to enable do the following:

1. Set `grails.plugin.springsecurity.ad.active=true`
2. Uncomment only the Active Directory properties 
3. Make sure the LDAP section is commented out **except** for this line which should be **set to false**.    
   ```
   grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.active=false
   ```
4. For each property, use the value matching your configuration.

   + For DeployR for Microsoft R Server 8.0.5:
     ```
     /*
      * DeployR Active Directory Configuration Properties
      *
      * To enable Active Directory uncomment the following
      * properties and provide property values matching your LDAP DIT:

## LDAP & Active Directory Configuration Properties

The following table presents the complete list of LDAP and Active Directory configuration properties.

>To use one of these configuration properties in the `deployr.groovy` external configuration file, you must prefix the property name with `grails.plugin.springsecurity`. For example, to use the `ldap.context.server='ldap://localhost:389'` property in `deployr.groovy`, you must write the property as such: `grails.plugin.springsecurity.ldap.context.server='ldap://localhost:389'`

<sup>\*</sup> These properties are for Active Directory.

## PAM Authentication

By default, the **PAM** security provider is disabled. To enable PAM authentication support, you must:

1.  Update the relevant properties in your DeployR external configuration file, `deployr.groovy`.
2.  Follow the DeployR server system files configuration changes outlined below.

PAM is the Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules provided to support dynamic authorization for applications and services in a Linux system. If DeployR is installed on a Linux system, then the PAM security provider allows users to authenticate with DeployR using their existing Linux system username and password.

>Basic authentication remains enabled even with PAM enabled.

**Step 1: Update the DeployR external configuration file**

Update the following properties in your DeployR external configuration file, `deployr.groovy`:

+ `deployr.security.pam.authentication.enabled`
+ `deployr.security.pam.groups.map`
+ `deployr.security.pam.default.role`

Relevant snippet from `deployr.groovy` file shown here:
```

```

**Step 2: Apply Configuration Changes to DeployR Server System Files**

1.  Before making any configuration changes to the server system files, [stop the DeployR server](deployr-common-administration-tasks.md#startstop).

1. Grant `root` permissions to launch the Tomcat server. This is required so the DeployR server can avail of PAM authentication services.

    1. Log in as `root` on your DeployR server.

    1. Using your preferred editor, edit the file `/opt/deployr/8.0.5/tomcat/tomcat7.sh`,

    1. Find the following section:

        - On Redhat/CentOS platforms:
          ```
          daemon --user "tomcat2" ${START_TOMCAT}
          ```

        - On SLES platforms:
          ```
          start_daemon -u r "tomcat2" ${START_TOMCAT}
          ```

    1. Change `"tomcat2"` to `"root"` as follows:

        - On Redhat/CentOS platforms:
          ```
          daemon --user "root" ${START_TOMCAT}
          ```

        - On SLES platforms:
          ```
          start_daemon -u r "root" ${START_TOMCAT}
          ```

    1. Save this change and close the file in your editor.

1. [Restart the server](deployr-common-administration-tasks.md#startstop).


>If you have enabled PAM authentication as part of the required steps for enabling R Session Process Controls, then please continue with your configuration using [these steps](#r-session-process-controls).



## CA Single Sign-On (SiteMinder) Pre-Authentication

By default, the **CA Single Sign-On** (formerly known as SiteMinder) security provider is disabled. To enable CA Single Sign-On support, you must first update CA Single Sign-On Policy Server configuration. Then, you must update the relevant properties in your DeployR external configuration file.

**To enable CA Single Sign-On support:**

1.  Define or update your CA Single Sign-On Policy Server configuration. For details on how to do this, [read here](deployr-admin-configure-ca-sso.md).

2.  Update the relevant properties in your DeployR external configuration file.
    This step assumes that:

    -   Your CA Single Sign-On Policy Server is properly configured and running
    -   You understand which header files are being used by your policy server

```
/*
* Siteminder Single Sign-On (Pre-Authentication) Policy Properties
*/

deployr.security.siteminder.preauth.enabled = false

// deployr.security.preauth.username.header
// Identify Siteminder username header, defaults to HTTP_SM_USER as used by Siteminder Tomcat 7 Agent.
deployr.security.preauth.username.header = 'HTTP_SM_USER'

// deployr.security.preauth.group.header
// Identify Siteminder groups header.
deployr.security.preauth.group.header = 'SM_USER_GROUP'

// deployr.security.preauth.group.separator
// Identify Siteminder groups delimiter header.
deployr.security.preauth.group.separator = '^'

// deployr.security.preauth.groups.map
// Allows you to map Siteminder group names to DeployR role names.
// NOTE: Siteminder group names must be defined using the distinguished
// name for the group. Group distinguished names are case sensitive.
// For example, your Siteminder distinguished group name
// "CN=finance,OU=company,DC=acme,DC=com" must appear in the map as
// "CN=finance,OU=company,DC=acme,DC=com". DeployR role names must
// begin with ROLE_ and must always be upper case.
deployr.security.preauth.groups.map = [ 'CN=finance,OU=company,DC=acme,DC=com' : 'ROLE_BASIC_USER',
                                  'CN=engineering,OU=company,DC=acme,DC=com' : 'ROLE_POWER_USER' ]
			
// deployr.security.preauth.default.role
// Optional, grant default DeployR Role to all Siteminder authenticated users:
deployr.security.preauth.default.role = 'ROLE_BASIC_USER'
```








## R Session Process Controls

By default, R sessions executing on the DeployR grid are not authorized to access files or directories outside of the R working directory. To enable broader file system access for a given R session to files or directories based on specific authenticated user ID and group ID credentials, you must first do ONE of the following:

-   Enable [PAM authentication](#pam-authentication), or
-   Enable [LDAP authentication](#ldap), or
-   Enable [Active Directory authentication](#active-directory-authentication)

Once you have enabled PAM, LDAP, or AD authentication, you must (Step 1) update the relevant process controls properties on the server **and then** (Step 2) apply system-level configuration changes to every single node on your DeployR grid, as follows:

### Step 1: Update Process Control Properties

After you've enabled either PAM, LDAP, or Active Directory authentication, you can update the relevant process control properties in your DeployR server external configuration file, `deployr.groovy`, on the main DeployR server:

-   deployr.security.r.session.process.controls.enabled
-   deployr.security.r.session.process.default.uid
-   deployr.security.r.session.process.default.gid

Relevant snippet from `deployr.groovy` file shown here:

        /*
        * DeployR R Session Process Controls Policy Configuration
        *
        * By default, each R session on the DeployR grid executes
        * with permissions inherited from the master RServe process
        * that was responsible for launching it.
        *
        * Enable deployr.security.r.session.process.controls to force
        * each individual R session process to execute with the
        * permissions of the end-user requesting the R session,
        * using their authenticated user ID and group ID.
        *
        * If this property is enabled but the uid/gid associated with
        * the end-user requesting the R session is not available,
        * then the R session process will execute using the default[uid,gid]
        * indicated on the following properties.
        *
        * The default[uid,gid] values indicated on these policy
        * configuration properties must correspond to a valid user and
        * group ID configured on each node on the DeployR grid.
        *
        * For example, if you installed DeployR as deployr-user then
        * we recommend using the uid/gid for deployr-user for these
        * default property values.
        */
        deployr.security.r.session.process.controls.enabled=false
        deployr.security.r.session.process.default.uid=9999
        deployr.security.r.session.process.default.gid=9999

### Step 2: Make System-Level Configuration Changes to Every Node

> **Before You Begin!** Make sure you've enabled the appropriate process control properties before beginning this step.

**For Non-Root Installs**

>Apply the following configuration changes on **each and every node** on your DeployR grid, including the default grid node.

On each machine hosting a grid node:

1.  Before making any configuration changes to system files, you must stop Rserve and any other DeployR-related services:

        cd /home/deployr-user/deployr/8.0.5
        ./stopAll.sh

2.  Grant `deployr-user` permission to execute a command as a `sudo` user so that the RServe process can be launched. This is required so that the DeployR server can enforce R session process controls.

    A. Log in as `root`.

    B. Using your preferred editor, edit the file:

        /etc/sudoers

    C. Find the following section:

        ## Command Aliases

    D. Add the following line to this section:

        Cmnd_Alias DEPLOYRRSERVE = /home/deployr-user/deployr/8.0.5/rserve/rserve.sh

    E. Find the following section:

        ## Allow root to run any commands anywhere

    F. Add or append `DEPLOYRRSERVE` for `%deployr-user` to this section:

        ## If an entry for %deployr-user is not found, add this line:
        %deployr-user      ALL = DEPLOYRRSERVE
        ## Otherwise append as shown:
        %deployr-user      ALL = DEPLOYRTOMCAT,DEPLOYRRSERVE

    G. Save these changes and close the file in your editor.

    H. Log out `root`.

3.  Update the DeployR `startAll.sh` shell script to take advantage of the `sudo` command configured above.

    A. Log in as `deployr-user`.

    B. Using your preferred editor, edit the file:

        /home/deployr-user/deployr/8.0.5/startAll.sh

    C. Find the following line:

        /home/deployr-user/deployr/8.0.5/rserve/rserve.sh start

    D. Change it to the following:

        sudo /home/deployr-user/deployr/8.0.5/rserve/rserve.sh start

    E. Save this change and close the file in your editor.

4.  Update the DeployR `stopAll.sh` shell script to take advantage of the `sudo` command configured above.

    A. Using your preferred editor, edit the file:

        /home/deployr-user/deployr/8.0.5/stopAll.sh

    B. Find the following line:

        /home/deployr-user/deployr/8.0.5/rserve/rserve.sh stop

    C. Change it to the following:

        sudo /home/deployr-user/deployr/8.0.5/rserve/rserve.sh stop

    D. Save this change and close the file in your editor.

5.  Set group privileges on the user directory containing the DeployR grid node install directory.

    A. Log in as `root`.

    B. Set group privileges.

         cd /home
         chmod -R g+rwx deployr-user

6.  Add each user that will authenticate with the server to the `deployr-user` group.

    A. Log in as `root`.

    B. Execute the following command to add each user to the `deployr-user` group.

        usermod -a -G deployr-user <some-username>

    C. Repeat step **B.** for each user that will authenticate with the server.

    D. Log out `root`.

7.  Restart Rserve and any other DeployR-related services on the machine hosting the DeployR grid node:

    A. Log in as `deployr-user`.

    B. Start Rserve and any other DeployR-related services:

        cd /home/deployr-user/deployr/8.0.5
        ./startAll.sh

1. Repeat these steps for each grid node.

**For Root Installs**

>Apply the following configuration changes on **each and every node** on your DeployR grid, including the default grid node.

On each machine hosting a grid node:

1.  Log in as `root`.

2.  Before making any configuration changes to system files, stop Rserve and any other DeployR-related services:

        cd /opt/deployr/8.0.5
        ./stopAll.sh

3.  Grant `root` permission to launch the RServe process. This is required so that each DeployR grid node can enforce R session process controls.

    A. Using your preferred editor, edit the file `/opt/deployr/8.0.5/rserve/rserve.sh` as follows:

    -   On Redhat/CentOS platforms, find the following section:

            daemon --user "apache"

        and, change `apache` to `root` as follows:

            daemon --user "root"

    -   On SLES platforms, find the following section:

            start_daemon -u r "apache"

        and, change `apache` to `root` as follows:

            start_daemon -u r "root"

    B. Save this change and close the file in your editor.

4.  Set group privileges on the DeployR install directory.

        cd /opt
        chown -R apache.apache deployr
        chmod -R g+rwx deployr

5.  Execute the following command to add each user to the `apache` group.
    **Repeat for each user that will authenticate with the server.**

        usermod -a -G apache <some-username>

6.  Restart Rserve and any other DeployR-related services:

        cd /home/deployr-user/deployr/8.0.5
        ./startAll.sh
        
1. Repeat these steps for each grid node.
