## Machine Learning Server 9.3

There are no announcements for package or function deprecation, discontinuation, or changes to existing functionality.

To learn more about this release, see [What's New](whats-new-in-machine-learning-server.md) for feature announcements and [Known issues](resources-known-issues.md) for descriptions and possible workarounds to known problems found in this release.

## Machine Learning Server 9.2.1

### RevoScaleR Package

|Function| Status | Replacement |

For more information, see [discontinued RevoScaleR functions](r-reference/revoscaler/revoscaler-defunct.md) and [deprecated RevoScaleR functions](r-reference/revoscaler/revoscaler-deprecated.md).

### RevoMods Package

In **RevoMods** functions are discontinued (all were intended for use solely by the R Productivity Environment discontinued in Microsoft R Server 8.0.3):

+ `?` (use the standard R `?`, previously masked)
+ `q` (use the standard R `q` function, previously masked)
+ `quit` (use the standard R `quit` function, previously masked)
+ `revoPlot` (use the standard R `plot` function)
+ `revoSource` (use the standard R `source` function)
 
## Microsoft R Server 9.0.1

### Changed in this release

+ R Server is built on Microsoft R Open 3.3.2 (R 3.3.2).
+ R packages added to MRO include `curl`, `Jsonlite`, and `R6`.
+ R packages added to R Server include `mrupdate` (for automated update checks) and `CompatibilityAPI` (to check for feature compatibility between versions).
+ DeployR (now referred to as operationalization) no longer supports MongoDB. Use PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or Azure SQL Database instead.

### Deprecated or Discontinued

+ RevoScaleR deprecated functions:
    + `RxHpcServer` (no replacement)
    + `rxReadXdf` (use `rxImport` or `rxDataStep`)

+ RevoScaleR discontinued functions:
    + (none)
     	

### Bug Fixes

+ Not available.

### Known Issues

See here: https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/resources-known-issues

## Microsoft R Server 8.0.5

### Deprecated or Discontinued

+ The **R Productivity Environment** (RPE) IDE for Revolution R Enterprise:
  + The RPE is now defunct. We recommend use of alternative IDEs.
  + These R packages that support the RPE have been removed: `revoIpe`, `pkgXMLBuilder`, `XML`, and `RevoRpeConnector`.

+ `RevoScaleR` changes:
    + These `RevoScaleR` functions are now deprecated:
	    + `rxImportToXdf` (use `rxImport`)
	    + `rxDataStepXdf` (use `rxDataStep`)
	    + `rxXdfToDataFrame` (use `rxDataStep`)
	    + `rxDataFrameToXdf` (use `rxDataStep`)

    + These `RevoScaleR` functions are now defunct:
    	+ `rxgetvarinfo` (use `rxGetVarInfo`)
    	+ `rxGetInfoXdf` (us `rxGetInfo`)
    	+ the `covariance` argument (only) to the `rxLinMod` function

### Changed in this release

+  A new internal variable, `.rxPredict` is available inside transformation functions to indicate that the data is being processed from a prediction rather than a model estimation.

+ **Microsoft R documentation** has been moved from the product distribution to MSDN. The “doc” directories in the RevoScaleR and RevoPemaR packages have been removed, as has the top-level R Server “doc” directory.

+ Microsoft R **licenses and Third Party Notices** files are now included in the new `MicrosoftR` package. The Revo.home() function now points to the location of this directory, and `Revo.home(“licenses”)` points to the “licenses” directory within. The `Revo.home(“doc”)` component is now defunct.

+ An opt-in telemetry feature allows you to anonymously help improve Microsoft R Server by enabling us to gather data on the R Server functions you use, operating system, R version, and RevoScaleR version. Turn it on using the `rxPrivacyControl` function in `RevoScaleR`.

**Bug Fixes**

+ `rxKmeans` now works with an `RxHadoopMR` compute context and an `RxTextData` data source.

+ When writing to an `RxTextData` data source using
`rxDataStep`, specifying `firstRowIsColNames` to `FALSE` in
the output data source will now correctly result in no
column names being written.

+ When writing to an `RxTextData` data source using
`rxDataStep`, setting `quoteMark` to `""` in the output data
source will now result in no quote marks written around
character data.

+ When writing to an `RxTextData` data source using
`rxDataStep`, setting `missingValueString` to `""` in the
output data source will now result in empty strings for
missing values.

+ Using `rxImport`, if `quotedDelimiters` was set to `TRUE`,
transforms could not be processed.

+ `rxImport` of `RxTextData` now reports a warning instead of
an error if mismatched quotes are encountered.

+ When using `rxImport` and appending to an `.xdf` file, a
combination of the use of `newName` and `newLevels` for
different variables in `colInfo` could result in `newLevels`
being ignored, resulting in a different set of factor levels
for the appended data.

+ When using `rxPredict`, with an in-formula transformation of
the dependent variable, an error was given if the variable
used in the transformation was not available in the
prediction data set.

+ Hadoop bug fix for incompatibility when using both HA and Kerberos on HDP.

+ Deployr default grid node and any additional nodes should have 20 slots by default

+ DeployR was generating very large (~52GB) catalina.out log files.

+ When running scripts in the DeployR Repository Manager's Test tab, any numeric values set to `0` were ignored and not included as part of the request.
