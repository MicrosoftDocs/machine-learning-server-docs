# Uninstall Microsoft R Client 

[!INCLUDE [retirement banner](~/includes/machine-learning-server-retirement.md)]

This article explains how to uninstall Microsoft R Client. **You do not have to uninstall R Client before installing a more recent version.**

## Uninstall on Windows

+ Remove Microsoft R Client like other applications using the Add/Remove dialog on Windows.

+ Alternately, you can use the same setup file used to install R Client to remove the program by specifying the /uninstall option on the command line such as:
  ```RClientSetup.exe /uninstall```


## Uninstall on Linux

## Program version and file locations

As a first step, use your package manager to list the currently installed Machine Learning Server packages. (Typically, CentOS and Red Hat systems use **yum**, Ubuntu systems use **apt-get**, and SLES systems use **zypper**):

If your package manager is **yum**:

```
yum list \*microsoft-r\*
```

If your package manager is **apt-get**:

```
apt list \*microsoft-r\*
```

If your package manager is **zypper**:

```
zypper search \*microsoft-r\*
```

## General instructions for all versions

Packages are registered in a database that tracks all package installations in the cluster. To update the database, use a package manager to remove the package: **yum** for Red Hat and CentOS, **zypper** for SUSE, or **apt-get** for Ubuntu.

Log in as root or a user with `sudo` privileges. If you are using `sudo`, precede commands requiring root privileges with `sudo` (for example, `sudo yum erase microsoft-r-server-mro-8.0`).

## How to uninstall

1. Uninstall Microsoft R Open (MRO) and remove any dependent packages used only by MRO:

    ```
    yum erase microsoft-r-server-mro-x.x 		#(CentOS/RHEL systems))
            apt-get remove microsoft-r-server-mro-x.x	# (Ubuntu systems)
            zypper remove microsoft-r-server-mro-x.x	# (SLES systems)
    ```
    
   where x.x is the version number.

2. On the root node, verify the location of other files that need to be removed: `

    ```
    ls /usr/lib64/microsoft-r
    ```
    
3. Remove the entire directory:

    ```
    rm -fr /usr/lib64/microsoft-r
    ```
    
The **rm** command removes the folder. Parameter "f" is for force and "r" for recursive, deleting everything under microsoft-r. This command is destructive and irrevocable, so be sure you have the correct directory before you press Enter.
