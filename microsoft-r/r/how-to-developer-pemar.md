# How to use the RevoPemaR library in Machine Learning Server

The **RevoPemaR** package provides a framework for writing custom parallel external memory algorithms in R, making use of the R reference classes introduced by John Chambers in R 2.12.

Parallel External Memory Algorithms (PEMA) are algorithms that eliminate in-memory data storage requirements, allowing data to be processed in chunks, in parallel, possibly on different nodes of a cluster. The results are then combined and processed at the end (or at the end of each iteration). The **RevoPemaR** package is used for writing custom PEMA algorithms in R. 

The custom PEMA functions created using the **RevoPemaR** framework are appropriate for small and large datasets, but are particularly useful in three common situations: 

1. To analyze data sets that are too large to fit in memory 
2. To create scalable data analysis routines that can be developed locally with smaller data sets, then deployed to larger data
3. To perform computations distributed over nodes in a cluster

## Installation

The **RevoPemaR** package is included with Microsoft Machine Learning Server and R Client (which also contains the **RevoScaleR** package). 

The **RevoPemaR** package can also be installed with a standard download of [Microsoft R Open (MRO)](https://mran.microsoft.com/open).

## About R Reference Classes

The PEMA classes used in **RevoPemaR** are based on R Reference Classes. We include a brief overview of some tips for using R Reference Classes here, before moving to the specifics of the PEMA classes.

R Reference Class objects are created using a generator function. This function has four important pieces of information:

+ *Name of the class*.
+ Inheritance or *superclasses* of the class. Fields and methods of parent reference classes are inherited.
+ *Fields* or member variables. These fields are accessed by reference (as in C++ or Java), so values of the fields for an object of this class can change.
+ *Methods* that can be invoked by objects of this class.

When working with reference class, keep these tips in mind:

+ Reference class generators are created using *setRefClass*. For the PEMA classes, we use a wrapper for that function, *setPemaClass*.
+ Field values are changed within methods using the non-local assignment operator (*\<\<-*)
+ The reference class object can be accessed in the methods using *.self*
+ The parent method can be accessed using *.callSuper*
+ Use the *usingMethods* call to declare that a method is used by another method.
+ The code for a method can be displayed using an instantiated reference class object, for example, *myRefClassObj$initialize*.
+ Methods are documented internally with an initial line of text, rather than in a .Rd file. This information is accessed using the $help method for the generator function.

## Tutorial introduction to RevoPemaR

This section contains an overview of a simple example of estimating the mean of a variable using the **RevoPemaR** framework. The key step is in creating a *PemaMean* reference class generator function that provides the fields and methods for computing the mean using a parallel external memory algorithm. This includes creating methods to compute the sum and number of observations for each chunk of data, to update these intermediate results, and at the end to use the intermediate results to compute the mean.

### Using setPemaClass to Create a Class Generator

Start by making sure that the **RevoPemaR** package is loaded:

	library(RevoPemaR)

To create a PEMA class generator function, use the *setPemaClass* function. It is a wrapper function for *setRefClass*. As with *setRefClass*, we specify four basic pieces of information when using *setPemaClass*: the class name, the superclasses, the fields, and the methods. The structure looks something like this:

	PemaMean <- setPemaClass(
		Class = "PemaMean",
		contains = "PemaBaseClass",
		fields = list( # To be written
			),
	methods = list( # To be written
	     ))

The *Class* is the class name of your choice. The *contains* argument must specify *PemaBaseClass* or a child class of *PemaBaseClass*. The specification of fields and methods follows.

### Specifying the fields for PemaMean

The fields or member variables of our class represent all of the variables we need in order to compute and store our intermediate and final results. Here are the fields we use for our “means” computation:

	fields = list(
		sum = "numeric",
		totalObs = "numeric",
        	totalValidObs = "numeric",
		mean = "numeric",
		varName = "character"
		),

### An Overview of the *methods* for *PemaMean*

There are five methods we specify for *PemaMean*. These methods are all in the *PemaBaseClass*, and need to be overloaded for any custom analysis.

-   *initialize*: initializes field values.
-   *processData*: processes a chunk of data and updates field values
-   *updateResults*: updates the field values of a PEMA class object from another
-   *processResults*: computes the final results from the final intermediate results
-   *getVarsToUse*: the names of the variables in the dataset used for analysis

### The *initialize* method

The primary use of the i*nitialize* method is to initialize field values. The one field that is initialized with user input in this example is the name of the variable to use in the computations, *varName*. Use of the ellipses in the function signature allows for initialization values to be passed up to the parent class using .*callSuper*, the first action in the *initialize* method after the documentation. Here is the beginning of our methods listing:

	methods = list(
	    initialize = function(varName = "", ...)
	    {
            'sum, totalValidObs, and mean are all initialized to 0'
            # callSuper calls the initialize method of the parent class
            callSuper(...)

The *pemaSetClass* function also provides additional functionality used in the *initialize* method to ensure that all of the methods of the class and its parent classes are included when an object is serialized. This is critical for distributed computing. To use this functionality, add the following to the initialize method:

	usingMethods(.pemaMethods)

(If you do not want to use this functionality you can omit this line and set *includeMethods* to FALSE in *setPemaClass*.)

Now we finish the field initialization, setting the *varName* field to the input value and setting the starting values for our computations to 0, remembering to use the double-arrow non-local assignment operator to set field values:

		varName <<- varName
		sum <<- 0
		totalObs <<- 0
	          totalValidObs <<- 0
	          mean <<- 0
	},


#### The *processData* method

The *processData* method is the core of an external memory algorithm. It processes a chunk of data and computes intermediate results, updating the field value(s). It takes as an argument a rectangular list of data vectors; typically only the variable(s) of interest is included. In our example code we do not compute the mean within this method; that occurs after we have processed all of the data. Here we compute and update the intermediate results: the sum and number of observations:

	processData = function(dataList)
	{
	    'Updates the sum and total observations from
	         the current chunk of data.'
	         sum <<- sum + sum(as.numeric(dataList[[varName]]),
	             na.rm = TRUE)

	         totalObs <<- totalObs + length(dataList[[varName]])

	     totalValidObs <<- totalValidObs +
	             sum(!is.na(dataList[[varName]]))
	         invisible(NULL)
	},


#### The *updateResults* method

The *updateResults* is the key method used when computations are done in parallel. Consider the following scenario:

1.  The master node on a cluster assigns each worker node the task of processing a series of chunks of data.
2.  The workers do so in parallel, each with their own instantiation of a reference class object. Each worker calls *processData* for each chunk of data it needs to process. In each call, the values of the fields of its reference class object are updated.
3.  Now the master process must collect the information from each of the nodes, and update all of the information in a single reference class object. This is done using the *updateResults* method, which takes as an argument another instance of the reference class. The reference class object from each of the nodes is processed by the master node, resulting in the final intermediate results in the master node’s reference class object’s fields.

Here is the *updateResults* method for our *PemaMean*:

	updateResults = function(pemaMeanObj)
	{
	        'Updates the sum and total observations from
	         another PemaMean object.'

	        sum <<- sum + pemaMeanObj$sum
	    totalObs <<- totalObs + pemaMeanObj$totalObs
	        totalValidObs <<- totalValidObs + pemaMeanObj$totalValidObs

	        invisible(NULL)
	},


#### The *processResults* method

The *processResults* performs any necessary computations to produce the final result from the accumulated intermediate results. In this case, it is simple; we divide the sum by the number of valid observations (assuming we have some):

	processResults = function()
	{
	    'Returns the sum divided by the totalValidObs.'
		if (totalValidObs > 0)
		{
			mean <<- sum/totalValidObs
		}
			else
		{
			mean <<- as.numeric(NA)
		}
		return( mean )
	},


####  The *getVarsToUse* method

The *getVarsToUse* method specifies the names of the variables in the dataset that are used in the analysis. Specifying this information can improve performance if reading data from disk.

	        getVarsToUse = function()
	        {
	            'Returns the varName.'
	            varName
	        }
		) # End of methods
	) # End of class generator


### Creating and Using a PemaMean Reference Class Object

#### Instantiating and Exploring a PemaMean Object

A version of the code in the previous section is contained within the **RevoPemaR** package and exported, so we can directly work with the *PemaMean* generator without first running the code. We can show the names of all the methods, including those that are explicitly overridden by the *PemaMean* class:

	PemaMean$methods()

	 [1] ".pemaMethods"                 ".pemaMethods#PemaBaseClass"  
	 [3] "callSuper"                    "compute"                     
	 [5] "copy"                         "copyFields"                  
	 [7] "createReturnObject"           "export"                      
	 [9] "field"                        "finalizeNode"                
	[11] "getClass"                     "getFieldList"                
	[13] "getRefClass"                  "getVarsToRead"               
	[15] "getVarsToUse"                 "getVarsToUse#PemaBaseClass"  
	[17] "hasConverged"                 "import"                      
	[19] "initFields"                   "initialize"                  
	[21] "initialize#PemaBaseClass"     "initIteration"               
	[23] "outputTrace"                  "processAllData"              
	[25] "processData"                  "processData#PemaBaseClass"   
	[27] "processResults"               "processResults#PemaBaseClass"
	[29] "setFieldList"                 "show"                        
	[31] "trace"                        "untrace"                     
	[33] "updateResults"                "updateResults#PemaBaseClass"
	[35] "usingMethods"   


Some of the methods (for example, *initIteration,* *getFieldList*) are inherited from the *PemaBaseClass*. Others (for example, *callSuper*, *methods*) are inherited from the base reference class generator.

We can use the *help* method with the generator function to get help on specific methods:

	PemaMean$help(initialize)

	Call:
	$initialize(varName = , ...)

	sum, totalValidObs, and mean are all initialized to 0

Next we generate a default *PemaMean* object, and print out the values of its fields (including those inherited):

	meanPemaObj <- PemaMean()
	meanPemaObj

	Reference class object of class "PemaMean"
	Reference class object of class "PemaMean" (from the global environment)
	Field ".isPemaObject":
	[1] TRUE
	Field ".isDistributedContext":
	[1] FALSE
	Field ".hasOutFile":
	[1] FALSE
	Field ".outFile":
	NULL
	Field ".append":
	[1] "none"
	Field ".overwrite":
	[1] FALSE
	Field ".onlyKeepTransformedData":
	[1] FALSE
	Field "traceLevel":
	[1] 0
	Field "iter":
	[1] 0
	Field "maxIters":
	[1] 2000
	Field "useRevoScaleR":
	[1] TRUE
	Field ".dataInMemory":
	[1] FALSE
	Field ".dataInMemoryPrepared":
	[1] FALSE
	Field "reportProgress":
	[1] 2
	Field "sum":
	[1] 0
	Field "totalObs":
	[1] 0
	Field "totalValidObs":
	[1] 0
	Field "mean":
	[1] 0
	Field "varName":
	[1] ""


We can also print out the code for a specific method using an instantiated object. For example, the initialize method of the *PemaMean* object in the **RevoPemaR** package is:

	meanPemaObj$initialize

	Class method definition for method initialize()
	function (varName = "", ...)
	{
	    "sum, totalValidObs, and mean are all initialized to 0"
	    callSuper(...)
	    usingMethods(.pemaMethods)
	    varName <<- varName
	    sum <<- 0
	    totalObs <<- 0
	    totalValidObs <<- 0
	    mean <<- 0
	}
	<environment: 0x000000003148ea40>

	 Methods used:  
	    ".pemaMethods", "callSuper", "usingMethods""


#### Using a *PemaMean* Object with the *pemaCompute* Function

The *pemaCompute* function takes two required arguments: an “analysis” object and a data source object. The analysis object must be generated by *setPemaClass* and inherit (directly or indirectly) from *PemaBaseClass*. The data source object must be either a data frame or a data source object supported by the **RevoScaleR** package if it is available. The ellipses take any additional information used in the *initialize* method.

Let’s compute a mean of some random numbers:

	set.seed(67)
	pemaCompute(pemaObj = meanPemaObj,
		data = data.frame(x = rnorm(1000)), varName = "x")

	[1] 0.00504128

If we again print the values of the fields of our meanPemaObj, we see the updated values:

	meanPemaObj

	Reference class object of class "PemaMean" (from the global environment)
	Field ".isPemaObject":
	[1] TRUE
	Field ".isDistributedContext":
	[1] FALSE
	Field ".hasOutFile":
	[1] FALSE
	Field ".outFile":
	NULL
	Field ".append":
	[1] "none"
	Field ".overwrite":
	[1] FALSE
	Field ".onlyKeepTransformedData":
	[1] FALSE
	Field "traceLevel":
	[1] 0
	Field "iter":
	[1] 1
	Field "maxIters":
	[1] 2000
	Field "useRevoScaleR":
	[1] TRUE
	Field ".dataInMemory":
	[1] FALSE
	Field ".dataInMemoryPrepared":
	[1] FALSE
	Field "reportProgress":
	[1] 2
	Field "sum":
	[1] 5.04128
	Field "totalObs":
	[1] 1000
	Field "totalValidObs":
	[1] 1000
	Field "mean":
	[1] 0.00504128
	Field "varName":
	[1] "x"

By default the *pemaCompute* method reinitializes the *pemaObj*. By setting the *initPema* flag to *FALSE*, we can add more data to our analysis:

	pemaCompute(pemaObj = meanPemaObj,
		data = data.frame(x = rnorm(1000)), varName = "x",
	      initPema = FALSE)
	[1] 0.001516969

	meanPemaObj$totalValidObs
	[1] 2000

The number of total valid observations is now 2000.

#### Using a *RevoScaleR* Data Source with the *pemaCompute* Function

In the previous section, we analyzed data in memory. The **RevoScaleR** package provides a data source framework that allows data to be automatically extracted in chunks from data on disk or in a database. It also provides the *.xdf* file format that can efficiently extract chunks of data.

We can use a sample .xdf file provided with the package. First we create a data source for this file:

	airXdf <- RxXdfData(file.path(rxGetOption("sampleDataDir"),
	    "AirlineDemoSmall.xdf"))

Using the *meanPemaObj* created above, we compute the mean of the variable *ArrDelay* (the arrival delay in minutes). The data in this file is stored in three blocks, with 200,000 rows in each block. The *pemaCompute* function processes these chunks one at a time:

	pemaCompute(meanPemaObj, data = airXdf, varName = "ArrDelay")

	Rows Read: 200000, Total Rows Processed: 200000, Total Chunk Time: 0.009 seconds
	Rows Read: 200000, Total Rows Processed: 400000, Total Chunk Time: 0.007 seconds
	Rows Read: 200000, Total Rows Processed: 600000, Total Chunk Time: 0.041 seconds
	[1] 11.31794

You can control the amount of progress reported to the console using the *reportProgress* field of *PemaBaseClass*.

#### Using *pemaCompute* in a Distributed Compute Context

**RevoScaleR** provides a number of distributed compute contexts, such as Hadoop clusters (Cloudera and Hortonworks). Use of the same PEMA reference class object on these platforms is experimental. It can be tried with data on those platforms by specifying the *computeContext* in the *pemaCompute* function.

## Additional Examples Using RevoPemaR

A number of examples are provided in the *demoScripts* directory of the *RevoPemaR* package. You can find the location of this directory by entering:

	path.package("RevoPemaR")

### Basic Text Mining Examples

Two PEMA text mining analyses are provided as examples.

-   *PemaPopularWords* accumulates the words used in a variable containing character data. The initialize method provides a variety of arguments to fine-tune the processing. The code for the reference class generator is provided in *PemaPopularWords.R*, and examples using it in *PemaPopularWordsEx.R*.
-   *PemaWordCount* counts instances of specified words in a variable containing character data. The code for the reference class generator is provided in *PemaWordCount.R*, and examples using it in *PemaWordCountEx.R*.

If you are using **RevoScaleR** and are interested in exploring text mining with a large dataset, instructions for downloading and code for importing Amazon reviews of fine foods is contained in the script *finefoodsImport.R*

### Performing By-Group Computations

A *PemaByGroup* class is included in *RevoPemaR* to facilitate by-group computations. Examples of using this class are provided in the *PemaByGroupEx.R* demo script. It is assumed that the relevant variables for each group can fit into memory, and are then processed by arbitrary R functions. It requires that data be pre-sorted by group before processing, so generally cannot be used in distributed compute contexts such as Hadoop.

### An Iterative PEMA Algorithm: Logistic Gradient Descent

A simple logistic gradient descent algorithm is provided as an example of an iterative algorithm that inherits from a parent class.

The *PemaGradDescent* class generator (in *PemaGradDescent.R*) specifies a number of important methods for iterative algorithms, for example:

-   *initIteration*: initializes the appropriate field values at the beginning of each iteration
-   *fn*: a placeholder for the computation of the objective (loss) function for gradient descent
-   *gradientFn*: a placeholder for the computation of the gradient function for gradient descent
-   *hasConverged*: checks convergence criteria

This class generator cannot be used directly. A child class generator must be created that at a minimum specifies the objective function (*fn*) and gradient function (*gradientFn*). An example is provided in *PemaLogitGD.R*, showing a logistic gradient descent. A simple example of its use is in *PemaLogitGDEx.R*.

## Debugging *RevoPemaR* Code

The R Reference Classes provide standard R debugging tools, and *trace* and *untrace* methods are provided in the base reference class.

The *PemaBaseClass* provides a simple way of printing trace output that is particularly useful in debugging code in a distributed environment. Calls to the *outputTrace* method within other methods print the specified text if the *traceLevel* field value exceeds or is equal to the *outTraceLevel* argument:

	meanPemaObj$outputTrace

	Class method definition for method outputTrace()
	function (text, outTraceLevel = 1)
	{
	    "Prints text if the traceLevel >= outTraceLevel"
	    if (length(traceLevel) == 0) {
	        warning("traceLevel has not been initialized.")
	    }
	    else if (traceLevel >= outTraceLevel) {
	        cat(text)
	    }
	}
