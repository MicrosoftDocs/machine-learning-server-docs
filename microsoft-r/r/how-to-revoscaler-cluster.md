# Cluster classification in RevoScaleR

*Clustering* is the general name for any of a large number of classification techniques that involve assigning observations to membership in one of two or more clusters on the basis of some distance metric.

### K-means Clustering

K-means clustering is a classification technique that groups observations of numeric data using one of several *iterative relocation* algorithms. Starting from some initial classification, which may be random, points are moved from cluster to another so as to minimize sums of squares. In RevoScaleR, the algorithm used is that of Lloyd.

To perform k-means clustering with RevoScaleR, use the *rxKmeans* function.

#### Clustering the Airline Data

As a first example of k-means clustering, we will cluster the arrival delay and scheduled departure time in the airline data 7% subsample. To start, we extract variables of interest into a new working data set to which we are writing additional information:

```
#  K-means Clustering

#   Clustering the Airline Data  
bigDataDir <- "C:/MRS/Data"
sampleAirData <- file.path(bigDataDir, "AirOnTime7Pct.xdf")
rxDataStep(inData = sampleAirData, outFile = "AirlineDataClusterVars.xdf",
	varsToKeep=c("DayOfWeek", "ArrDelay", "CRSDepTime", "DepDelay"))
```

We specify the variables to cluster as a formula, and specify the number of clusters we’d like. Initial centers for these clusters are then chosen at random.

```
kclusts1 <- rxKmeans(formula= ~ArrDelay + CRSDepTime, 
	data = "AirlineDataClusterVars.xdf",
	seed = 10,
	outFile = "airlineDataClusterVars.xdf", numClusters=5)
kclusts1
```

This produces the following output (because the initial centers are chosen at random, your output will probably look different):

```
Call:
rxKmeans(formula = ~ArrDelay + CRSDepTime, data = "AirlineDataClusterVars.xdf", 
	outFile = "AirlineDataClusterVars.xdf", numClusters = 5)

Data: "AirlineDataClusterVars.xdf"

	[9] "betweenss"     "cluster"       "params"        "formula"      
[13] "call"     
```

The value returned by *rxKmeans* is a list similar to the list returned by the standard R kmeans function. The printed output shows a subset of this information, including the number of valid and missing observations, the cluster sizes, the cluster centers, and the within-cluster sums of squares.

The cluster membership component is returned if the input is a data frame, but if the input is a .xdf file, cluster membership is returned only if *outFile* is specified, in which case it is returned not as part of the return object, but as a column in the specified file. In our example, we specified an *outFile*, and we see the cluster membership variable when we look at the file with *rxGetInfo*:

```
rxGetInfo("AirlineDataClusterVars.xdf", getVarInfo=TRUE)
	File name: AirlineDataClusterVars.xdf 
	Number of observations: 10399755 
	Number of variables: 5 
	Number of blocks: 19 
	Compression type: zlib 
	Variable information: 
	Var 1: DayOfWeek
		7 factor levels: Mon Tues Wed Thur Fri Sat Sun
	Var 2: ArrDelay, Type: integer, Low/High: (-1233, 2453)
	Var 3: CRSDepTime, Type: numeric, Storage: float32, Low/High: (0.0000, 24.0000)
	Var 4: DepDelay, Type: integer, Low/High: (-1199, 2467)
	Var 5: .rxCluster, Type: integer, Low/High: (1, 5)
```

#### Using the Cluster Membership Information

A common follow-up to clustering is to use the cluster membership information to see whether a given model varies appreciably from cluster to cluster. Since we can use the *rowSelection* argument to extract a single cluster on the fly, there is no need to sort the data first. As an example, we fit our original linear model of ArrDelay by DayOfWeek for two of the clusters:

```
#   Using the Cluster Membership Information
	
clust1Lm <- rxLinMod(ArrDelay ~ DayOfWeek, "AirlineDataClusterVars.xdf",
	rowSelection = .rxCluste r == 1 )
clust5Lm <- rxLinMod(ArrDelay ~ DayOfWeek, "AirlineDataClusterVars.xdf", 
	rowSelection = .rxCluster == 5)
summary(clust1Lm)
summary(clust5Lm)
```

Looking at the summary for *clust1Lm* shows the following:

```
Call:
rxLinMod(formula = ArrDelay ~ DayOfWeek, data = "AirlineDataClusterVars.xdf", 
	rowSelection = .rxCluster == 1)
