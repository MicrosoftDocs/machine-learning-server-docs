# Crosstabs using RevoScaleR

Crosstabs, also known as *contingency tables* or *crosstabulations*, are a convenient way to summarize cross-classified categorical data—that is, data that can be tabulated according to multiple levels of two or more factors. If only two factors are involved, the table is sometimes called a *two-way table*. If three factors are involved, the table is sometimes called a *three-way table*.

For large data sets, cross-tabulations of binned numeric data, that is, data that has been converted to a factor where the levels represent ranges of values, can be a fast way to get insight into the relationships among variables. In RevoScaleR, the *rxCube* function is the primary tool to create contingency tables.

For example, the built-in data set *UCBAdmissions* includes information on admissions by gender to various departments at the University of California at Berkeley. We can look at the contingency table as follows:

	UCBADF <- as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)
	z <- rxCube(Freq ~ Gender:Admit, data = UCBADF)


(Because cross-tabulations are explicitly about exploring interactions between variables, multiple predictors must always be specified using the interaction operator ":", and not the terms operator "+".)

Typing *z* yields the following output:

	Call:
	rxCube(formula = Freq ~ Gender:Admit, data = UCBADF)
	
	Cube Results for: Freq ~ Gender:Admit
	Data: UCBADF
	Dependent variable(s): Freq
	Number of valid observations: 24
	Number of missing observations: 0 
	Statistic: Freq means 
	 
	  Gender    Admit      Freq Counts
	1   Male Admitted 199.66667      6
	2 Female Admitted  92.83333      6
	3   Male Rejected 248.83333      6
	4 Female Rejected 213.00000      6

This data set is widely used in statistics texts because it illustrates Simpson’s paradox, which is that in some cases a comparison that holds true in a number of groups is reversed when those groups are aggregated to form a single group. From the preceding table, in which admissions data is aggregated across all departments, it would appear that males are admitted at a higher rate than women. However, if we look at the more granular analysis by department, we find that in four of the six departments, women are admitted at a higher rate than men:

	z2 <- rxCube(Freq ~ Gender:Admit:Dept, data = UCBADF)
	z2

This yields the following output:
	
	Call:
	rxCube(formula = Freq ~ Gender:Admit:Dept, data = UCBADF)
	
	Cube Results for: Freq ~ Gender:Admit:Dept
	Data: UCBADF
	Dependent variable(s): Freq
	Number of valid observations: 24
	Number of missing observations: 0 
	Statistic: Freq means 
	 
	   Gender    Admit Dept Freq Counts

## Letting the Data Speak Example 1: Analyzing U.S. 2000 Census Data

The CensusWorkers.xdf data set contains a subset of the U.S. 2000 5% Census for individuals aged 20 to 65 who worked at least 20 weeks during the year from three states. Let’s examine the relationship between wage income (represented in the data set by the variable *incwage*) and age.

A useful way to observe the relationship between numeric variables is to bin the predictor variable (in our case, age), and then plot the mean of the response for each bin. The simplest way to bin age is to use the F() wrapper within our initial formula; it creates a separate bin for each distinct value of age. (More precisely, it creates a bin of length one from the low value of age to the high value of age—if some ages are missing in the original data set, bins are created for them anyway.)

We create our original model as follows:

	#  Letting the data speak: Example 1
	
	readPath <- rxGetOption("sampleDataDir")
	censusWorkers <- file.path(readPath, "CensusWorkers.xdf")
	censusWorkersCube <- rxCube(incwage ~ F(age), data=censusWorkers)


We first look at the results in tabular form by typing the returned object name, *censusWorkersCube*, which yields the following output:
	
	Call:
	rxCube(formula = incwage ~ F(age), data = censusWorkers)
	
	Cube Results for: incwage ~ F(age)
	File name:
	    C:\Program Files\Microsoft\MRO-for-RRE\8.0\R-3.2.2\library\RevoScaleR\SampleData\CensusWorkers.xdf

	45    64 32964.57   2248
	46    65 31698.98   1625

As we wanted, the table contains average values of *incwage* for each level of *age*. If we want to create a plot of the results, we can use the *rxResultsDF* function to conveniently convert the output into a data frame. The *F\_age* factor variable will automatically be converted back to an integer *age* variable. Then we can plot the data using *rxLinePlot*:

	censusWorkersCubeDF <- rxResultsDF(censusWorkersCube)
	rxLinePlot(incwage ~ age, data=censusWorkersCubeDF, 
	    title="Relationship of Income and Age")

The resulting plot shows clearly the relationship of income on age:

## Transforming Data

Because crosstabs require categorical data for the predictors, you have to do some work to crosstabulate continuous data. In the previous section, we saw that the F() wrapper can do a transformation within a formula. The *transforms* argument to *rxCrossTabs* can be used to give you greater control over such transformations.

For example, the *kyphosis* data from the *rpart* package consists of one categorical variable, *Kyphosis*, and three continuous variables *Age*, *Number*, and *Start*. The *Start* variable indicates the topmost vertebra involved in a certain type of spinal surgery, and has a range of 1 to 18. Since there are 7 cervical vertebrae and 12 thoracic vertebrae, we can specify a transform that classifies the start variable as either cervical or thoracic as follows:

	#  Transforming Data
	  
	cut(Start, breaks=c(0, 7.5, 19.5), labels=c("cervical", "thoracic"))

Similarly, we can create a factorized Age variable as follows (in the original data, age is given in months; with our set of breaks, we cut the data into ranges of years):

	cut(Age, breaks=c(0, 12, 60, 119, 180, 220), labels=c("<1", "1-4", 
	    "5-9", "10-15", ">15"))

We can now crosstabulate the data using the preceding transforms and it is instructive to start by looking at the three two-way tables formed by tabulating Kyphosis with the three predictor variables:

	library(rpart)
	rxCube(~ Kyphosis:Age, data = kyphosis, 
	    transforms=list(Age = cut(Age, breaks=c(0, 12, 60, 119, 
	    180, 220), labels=c("<1", "1-4", "5-9", "10-15", ">15"))))
	Call:
	rxCube(formula = ~Kyphosis:Age, data = kyphosis, transforms = list(Age = cut(Age, 
	    breaks = c(0, 12, 60, 119, 180, 220), labels = c("<1", "1-4", 
	        "5-9", "10-15", ">15"))))
	
	Cube Results for: ~Kyphosis:Age
	Data: kyphosis
	Number of valid observations: 81
	Number of missing observations: 0 
	 
	   Kyphosis   Age Counts
	1    absent    <1     13
	2   present    <1      0
	3    absent   1-4     13
	4   present   1-4      4
	5    absent   5-9     17
	6   present   5-9      6
	7    absent 10-15     19
	8   present 10-15      7
	9    absent   >15      2
	10  present   >15      0
	rxCube(~ Kyphosis:F(Number), data = kyphosis)
	Call:
	rxCube(formula = ~Kyphosis:F(Number), data = kyphosis)
	
	Cube Results for: ~Kyphosis:F(Number)
	Data: kyphosis
	Number of valid observations: 81
	Number of missing observations: 0 
	 
	   Kyphosis F_Number Counts
	1    absent        2     12
	2   present        2      0
	3    absent        3     19
	4   present        3      4
	5    absent        4     16
	6   present        4      2
	7    absent        5     12
	8   present        5      5
	9    absent        6      2
	10  present        6      2
	11   absent        7      2
	12  present        7      3
	13   absent        8      0
	14  present        8      0
	15   absent        9      1
	16  present        9      0
	17   absent       10      0
	18  present       10      1
	
	rxCube(~ Kyphosis:Start, data = kyphosis, 
	    transforms=list(Start = cut(Start, breaks=c(0, 7.5, 19.5), 
	    labels=c("cervical", "thoracic"))))
	Call:
	rxCube(formula = ~Kyphosis:Start, data = kyphosis, transforms = list(Start = cut(Start, 
	    breaks = c(0, 7.5, 19.5), labels = c("cervical", "thoracic"))))
	
	Cube Results for: ~Kyphosis:Start
	Data: kyphosis
	Number of valid observations: 81
	Number of missing observations: 0 
	 
	  Kyphosis    Start Counts
	1   absent cervical      8
	2  present cervical      9
	3   absent thoracic     56
	4  present thoracic      8


From these, we see that the probability of the post-operative complication Kyphosis seems to be greater if the *Start* is a cervical vertebra and as more vertebrae are involved in the surgery. Similarly, it appears that the dependence on age is non-linear: it first increases with age, peaks in the range 5-9, and then decreases again.

## Cross-Tabulation with rxCrossTabs

The *rxCrossTabs* function is an alternative to the *rxCube* function, which performs the same calculations, but displays its results in format similar to the standard R *xtabs* function. For some purposes, this format can be more informative than the matrix-like display of *rxCube*, and in some situations can be more compact as well.

As an example, consider again the admission data example:

	#  Cross-Tabulation with rxCrossTabs
	  
	z3 <- rxCrossTabs(Freq ~ Gender:Admit:Dept, data = UCBADF)
	z3
	Call:
	rxCrossTabs(formula = Freq ~ Gender:Admit:Dept, data = UCBADF)
	
	Cross Tabulation Results for: Freq ~ Gender:Admit:Dept
	Data: UCBADF
	Dependent variable(s): Freq
	Number of valid observations: 24
	Number of missing observations: 0 
	Statistic: sums 
	 
	Freq, Dept = A (sums):
	        Admit

You can see, for example, that in Department A, 62 percent of male applicants are admitted, but 82 percent of female applicants are admitted, and in Department B, 63 percent of male applicants are admitted, while 68 percent of female applicants are admitted.

## A Large Data Example

The power of *rxCrossTabs* is most evident when you need to tabulate a data set that won’t fit into memory. For example, in the large airline data set AirOnTime87to12.xdf, you can obtain the mean arrival delay by carrier and day of week as follows (if you have downloaded the data set, modify the first line as follows to reflect your local path):

#  A Large Data Example
  
	bigDataDir <- "C:/MRS/Data"

	arrDelayXT <- rxCrossTabs(ArrDelay ~ UniqueCarrier:DayOfWeek, 
	    data = bigAirData, blocksPerRead = 30)
	print(arrDelayXT)

Gives the following output:

## Using Sparse Cubes

An additional tool that may be useful when using *rxCube* and *rxCrossTabs* with large data is the *useSparseCube* parameter.  Compiling cross-tabulations of categorical data can sometimes result in a large number of cells with zero counts, yielding at its core a “sparse matrix”.  In the usual case, memory is allocated for every cell in the cube, but large cubes may overwhelm memory resources. If we instead allocate space only for cells with positive counts, such operations may often proceed successfully.

As an example, let’s look at the airline data again and construct a case where the cross-tabulation yields many zero entries.  As the overwhelming number of flights in the data set were not canceled, by appending the *Cancelled* predictor in the formula, we would expect a large number of categorical predictor combinations to have zero observations.  Because the *Cancelled* predictor is a logical rather than a factor variable, we need to use the *F(.)* function to convert it.

	bigDataDir <- "C:/MRS/Data"
	bigAirData <- file.path(bigDataDir, "AirOnTime87to12/AirOnTime87to12.xdf")

	arrDelaySparse <- rxCube(ArrDelay ~ UniqueCarrier:DayOfWeek:F(Cancelled),
                         data = bigAirData, blocksPerRead = 30, useSparseCube = TRUE)
	print(arrDelaySparse)

This gives the following output.  We get 210 rows with F_Cancelled = 0. By default, if useSparseCube=TRUE, rows with zero counts are removed from the result.
	
	Call:
	rxCube(formula = ArrDelay ~ UniqueCarrier:DayOfWeek:F(Cancelled), 
	   data = bigAirData, useSparseCube = TRUE, blocksPerRead = 30)

While this particular example will likely run successfully to completion even on a minimally equipped modern computer without setting the *useSparseCube* flag to *TRUE*, it illustrates how one can quickly start to see the number of zero entries accumulate in an *rxCube* computation.  With larger data sets and a larger number of categorical variable combinations, however, this setting may allow computations of cubes that would not otherwise fit in memory.

For the *rxCrossTabs* function, the *useSparseCube* option works exactly the same internally. However, because *rxCrossTabs* always returns a table, it may require more memory to format its result than *rxCube*. If you have an extremely large contingency table, we recommend *rxCube* with *useSparseCube=TRUE* for the greatest chance of completing the computation.  The *useSparseCube* flag may also be used with *rxSummary*.

Tests of Independence on Cross-Tabulated Data
---------------------------------------------

One common use of contingency tables is to test whether the tabulated variables are independent. RevoScaleR includes several tests of independence, all of which expect data in the standard R *xtabs* format. You can get data in this format from the *rxCrossTabs* function by using the argument *returnXtabs=TRUE*:

	#  Tests of Independence on Cross-Tabulated Data
	  
	bigDataDir <- "C:/MRS/Data"
	bigAirData <- file.path(bigDataDir, "AirOnTime87to12/AirOnTime87to12.xdf")
	arrDelayXTab <- rxCrossTabs(ArrDel15~ UniqueCarrier:DayOfWeek, 
	    data = bigAirData, blocksPerRead = 30, returnXtabs=TRUE)

>The `blocksPerRead` argument is ignored if run locally using R Client. [Learn more...](tutorial-revoscaler-data-import-transform.md#chunking)

You can then use this as input to any of the following functions:

-   *rxChiSquaredTest*: performs Pearson’s chi-squared test of independence.
-   *rxFisherTest*: performs Fisher’s exact test of independence.
-   *rxKendallCor*: performs a Kendall tau test of independence. There are three flavors of test, a, b, and c; by default, the b flavor, which accounts for ties, is used.

(In fact, regular *rxCrossTabs* or *rxCube* output can be used as input to these functions, but they are converted to *xtabs* format first, so it is somewhat more efficient to have *rxCrossTabs* return the *xtabs* format directly.)

Here we use the *arrDelayXTab* data created preceding and perform a Pearson’s chi-squared test of independence on it:

	rxChiSquaredTest(arrDelayXTab)

Gives the following output:

	Chi-squared test of independence between UniqueCarrier and DayOfWeek 
	 X-squared  df p-value
	  105645.8 174       0

For large contingency tables such as this one, the chi-squared test is the tool of choice. For smaller tables, particularly those with cells with expected counts fewer than five, Fisher’s exact test is useful. On a large table, however, Fisher’s exact test may not be an option. For example, if we try it on our airline table, it returns an error:

	rxFisherTest(arrDelayXTab)
	
	 Error in FUN(tbl[, , i], ...) : FEXACT error 40.
	 Out of workspace. 

To show the Fisher test, we return to the admissions data from the beginning of the article. This time we use *rxCrossTabs* to return an *xtabs* object:

	UCBADF <- as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)
	admissCTabs <- rxCrossTabs(Freq ~ Gender:Admit, data = UCBADF, 
	    returnXtabs=TRUE)

We then call *rxFisherTest* on the resulting table:

	rxFisherTest(admissCTabs)
	Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data 
	 estimate 1 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper      p-value
	   1.840856     1.621356     2.091246 4.835903e-22
	   HA: two.sided 
	   H0:  odds ratio = 1

The chi-squared test works equally well on this example:

	rxChiSquaredTest(admissCTabs)	
	Chi-squared test of independence between Gender and Admit 
	 X-squared df      p-value
	   91.6096  1 1.055797e-21

In both cases, we are given indisputable evidence of the independence of our two predictor factors. For this example, we could have as easily used the standard R functions *chisq.test* and *fisher.test*. The RevoScaleR enhancements, however, permit *rxChisSquaredTest* and *rxFisherTest* to work on *xtabs* objects with multiple tables. For example, if we expand our examination of the admissions data to include the department info, we obtain a multi-way contingency table:

	admissCTabs2 <- rxCrossTabs(Freq ~ Gender:Admit:Dept, data = UCBADF,
	    returnXtabs=TRUE)

The chi-squared and Fisher’s exact test results are shown as follows; notice that they provide a test of independence between Gender and Admit for each level of Dept:

	rxChiSquaredTest(admissCTabs2)

	 Chi-squared test of independence between Gender and Admit 
	          X-squared df      p-value
	 Dept==A 16.37177373  1 5.205468e-05

	 Dept==F  0.21824336  1 6.403817e-01

	rxFisherTest(admissCTabs2)

	 Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data 
	        odds ratio 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper      p-value
	 Dept==A  0.3495628    0.1970420    0.5920417 1.669189e-05

Like Fisher’s exact test, the Kendall tau correlation test works best on smaller contingency tables. Here is an example of what it returns when applied to our admissions data (the results differ from run to run as the underlying algorithm relies on sampling):

## Odds Ratios and Risk Ratios

Another common task associated with 2 x 2 contingency tables is the calculation of odds ratios and risk ratios (also known as relative risk). The two functions *rxOddsRatio* and *rxRiskRatio* in RevoScaleR can be used to compute these quantities. The odds ratio and the risk ratio are closely related: the odds ratio computes the relative odds of an event among two or more groups, while the risk ratio computes the relative probabilities of an event. Consider again the contingency table *admissCTabs*:

	#  Odds Ratios and Risk Ratios
	  
	admissCTabs
	        
			Admit
	Gender   Admitted Rejected
	  Male       1198     1493
	  Female      557     1278


In this example, the odds of being admitted as a male are 1198/1493, or about 4 to 5 against. The odds of being admitted as a female are 557/1278, or about 4 to 9 against. The odds ratio is (1198/1493)/(557/1278), or 1.8 greater odds that a male will be admitted as opposed to a woman.

	    1.84108

The risk ratio, by contrast, compares the probabilities of being *rejected*, that is, 1493/(1198+1493) for a man versus 1278/(557+1278) for a woman. So here the risk ratio is 0.697 (the probability of a woman being rejected) divided by 0.555 (the probability of a man being rejected), or 1.255:
